  title = {Contributions of Aromatic Pairs of Human {{Gamma}}-{{D}}-{{Crystallin}} to Its Folding, Stability, Aggregation, and Interaction with Human {{Alpha B}}-{{Crystallin}}},
  copyright = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/7582},
  abstract = {Two distinct groups of proteins, a-crystallins and [Beta][gamma]-crystallins, constitute 90\% of the vertebrate eye lens soluble proteins. Long-term solubility and stability against unfolding and aggregation are essential properties of crystallins and crucial to the function of the lens. Aggregation of crystallins in the lens causes light scattering and directly contributes to development of cataract, the leading cause of blindness in the world. The amino acid determinants of these biochemical/biophysical properties of crystallins are not entirely understood. Aromatic residues in proteins have been shown to be important determinants of their folding pathways, native-state stability, aggregation propensity and other intermolecular interactions. In this thesis study, I have investigated the contributions of the paired aromatic residues of human yD-crystallin (H[gamma]D-Crys) to its folding, stability, aggregation, and interaction with the chaperone human aB-crystallin (H[alpha][Beta]-Crys). H[gamma]D-Crys is a highly stable protein that remains folded in the nucleus of the eye lens for the majority of an individual's lifetime. Like other [Beta][gamma]-crystallins, H[gamma]D-Crys exhibits two homologous crystallin domains, each containing two Greek key motifs and eight [Beta]-strands. Six conserved aromatic pairs (four Tyr/Tyr, one Tyr/Phe and one Phe/Phe) are present in H[gamma]D-Crys. Four among them are located at conserved [Beta]-hairpins of the Greek key motifs, thus termed "Greek key pairs". The Greek key pairs have the consensus sequence Y/FXXXXY/FXG and are one of the defining features of the [Beta][[gamma]-crystallin family. Ultraviolet (UV) damage to these aromatic residues in [Beta][gamma]-crystallins may contribute to unfolding and aggregation of the proteins, leading to development of cataract. [Alpha]-Crystallins belong to the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family and have both structural and chaperone functions in the lens. Human a-crystallins form polydisperse oligomers of 15-60 subunits, with aA:aB ratio about 3:1 in vivo. The core a-crystallin domain (aCD) of acrystallins has an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like p-sandwich fold, but the quaternary structure of acrystallin remains to be fully solved. Like other sHsps, a-crystallins exert their chaperone function by sequestering partially-unfolded and aggregation-prone substrates in an ATPindependent manner, thus preventing their aggregation. The chaperone-substrate interactions of a-crystallins and other sHsps remain poorly understood. To investigate the roles of the paired aromatic residues in H[gamma]D-Crys, mutant proteins with these aromatic residues substituted with alanines were constructed and expressed in E. coli. All mutant proteins maintained native-like secondary structures by circular dichroism (CD). Except F 115A and F 117A, all mutant proteins had lower thermal stability than the wildtype (WT) protein. Equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments in guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) showed that all mutant proteins had lower thermodynamic stability than the WT protein. Nterminal domain (N-td) substitutions shifted the N-td transitions to lower GuHCl concentrations, but the C-terminal domain (C-td) transitions remained unaffected. C-td substitutions led to a more synchronized unfolding/refolding process of the N-td and C-td, and the overall transitions shifted to lower GuHCl concentrations. These results were consistent with a sequential unfolding/refolding model of H[gamma]D-Crys, in which the N-td unfolds first and refolds last. The Greek key pairs had larger contributions to both thermal stability and thermodynamic stability than the non-Greek-key pairs. Aromatic-aromatic interaction energy was estimated by double mutant cycles as 1.5-2.0 kcal/mol. To distinguish the effects in unfolding and refolding, kinetic experiments were also performed. In kinetic unfolding experiments, N-td substitutions accelerated the early phase of unfolding, while C-td substitutions accelerated the late phase. For refolding, only substitutions of the second Greek key pair of each crystallin domain slowed refolding: N-td substitutions Y45A and Y5OA affected the late phase while Y133A and Y138A affected the early phase of the overall refolding reaction. The second Greek key may serve as a nucleation site during the folding of the double-Greek-key crystallin domain. The aggregation pathway that competes with productive refolding in vitro, as well as the suppression of aggregation by chaperone H[alpha]B-Crys were also investigated for mutant H[gamma]D-Crys variants with replacements of the Greek key paired residues. The WT and the mutant H[gamma]D-Crys behaved very similarly, in term of aggregation kinetics and final aggregation level, indicating that these aromatic pairs played minimal role in the aggregation process. The efficiencies of aggregation suppression by H[alpha]B-Crys, as well as the H[alpha]B-bound conformations characterized by the fluorescence of H[gamma]B-H[gamma]D complexes were also very similar for the WT and mutant HyDCrys, arguing against a critical role of these aromatic pairs in the chaperone recognition process. Together with the earlier results, it can also be concluded that stability and refolding kinetics of H[gamma]D-Crys were not critical determinants for its refolding-induced aggregation as well as HaBCrys recognition. Both of these processes may rely on features of the folding intermediate in a very early stage of Greek key refolding. The tryptophan fluorescence of the H[alpha]B-H[gamma]D complexes with WT or mutant H[gamma]D-Crys resembled a partially unfolded state of HyD-Crys, consistent with the tryptophans being part of the contact sites with the chaperone H[alpha]B-Crys.},

  abstract = {Human [gamma]D crystallin (H[gamma]D-Crys) is a monomeric, two domain, primarily P-sheet protein found in high concentrations in the human eye lens. H[gamma]D-Crys and other crystallins are found in insoluble protein inclusions associated with the eye disease cataract. H[gamma]D-Crys is expressed in utero and does not regenerate during life, thus necessitating high stability and solubility. Covalent damage, including glutamine deamidation, of the lens crystallins increases with age and as a result of exposure to environmental insults. Such covalent damage may cause partial-unfolding into aggregation-prone confomations that cause cataract. The in vitro stability of H[gamma]D-Crys was analyzed in the denaturant guanidine h[gamma]Drochloride at pH 7.0 and 370C. An off-pathway aggregation reaction that competed with refolding was previously reported when H[gamma]D-Crys was refolded to less than 1 M GuHC1. Equilibrium transitions of H[gamma]D-Crys were best fit to a three-state model suggesting the presence of a partially-folded intermediate that likely had a structured C-terminal domain (C-td) and unstructured N-terminal domain (N-td). Similarly, previous analyses revealed a sequential domain refolding pathway where the C-td refolds first followed by the N-td.},

Schizophrenia's strongest genetic association at a population level involves variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, but the genes and molecular mechanisms accounting for this have been challenging to identify. Here we show that this association arises in part from many structurally diverse alleles of the complement component 4 (C4) genes. We found that these alleles generated widely varying levels of C4A and C4B expression in the brain, with each common C4 allele associating with schizophrenia in proportion to its tendency to generate greater expression of C4A. Human C4 protein localized to neuronal synapses, dendrites, axons, and cell bodies. In mice, C4 mediated synapse elimination during postnatal development. These results implicate excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia and may help explain the reduced numbers of synapses in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Developing reliable, predictive animal models for complex psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, is essential to increase our understanding of the neurobiological basis of the disorder and for the development of novel drugs with improved therapeutic efficacy. All available animal models of schizophrenia fit into four different induction categories: developmental, drug-induced, lesion or genetic manipulation, and the best characterized examples of each type are reviewed herein. Most rodent models have behavioural phenotype changes that resemble `positive-like' symptoms of schizophrenia, probably reflecting altered mesolimbic dopamine function, but fewer models also show altered social interaction, and learning and memory impairment, analogous to negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia respectively. The negative and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are resistant to treatment with current antipsychotics, even after remission of the psychosis, which limits their therapeutic efficacy. The MATRICS initiative developed a consensus on the core cognitive deficits of schizophrenic patients, and recommended a standardized test battery to evaluate them. More recently, work has begun to identify specific rodent behavioural tasks with translational relevance to specific cognitive domains affected in schizophrenia, and where available this review focuses on reporting the effect of current and potential antipsychotics on these tasks. The review also highlights the need to develop more comprehensive animal models that more adequately replicate deficits in negative and cognitive symptoms. Increasing information on the neurochemical and structural CNS changes accompanying each model will also help assess treatments that prevent the development of schizophrenia rather than treating the symptoms, another pivotal change required to enable new more effective therapeutic strategies to be developed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Cortical Midline Structures (CMS) play a critical role in self-reflection, together with the insula. Abnormalities in self-referential processing and its neural underpinnings have been reported in schizophrenia and at-risk populations, suggesting they might be markers of psychotic vulnerability. Psychometric measures of schizotypal traits may be used to index psychosis proneness (PP) in nonclinical samples. It remains an unresolved question whether differences in self-reflective processing are associated with PP.
METHOD: Six hundred students completed the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences Questionnaire, positive subscale. Two groups were formed from the extremes of the distribution (total N = 36). fMRI was used to examine CMS/insula function during a self-reflection task. Participants judged personality trait sentences about self and about an acquaintance.
RESULTS: High PP subjects attributed less positive traits to others (i.e., acquaintances) than subjects with low PP. Across groups, the contrasts self $>$ semantic and self $>$ other induced activation in CMS and insula, whereas other $>$ semantic did not produce insula activation. Other $>$ self induced posterior cingulate cortex activation in low PP but not in high PP. In addition, high PP subjects showed stronger activation than low PP in left insula during self $>$ semantic. Examining valence effects revealed that high PP individuals showed increased activation in left insula, right dMPFC, and left vMPFC for positive self-related traits, and in bilateral insula, ACC, and right dMPFC for negative self-related traits.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that aspects of self-referential processing and underlying brain mechanisms are similar in clinical and subclinical (high PP) forms of psychosis, suggesting that these may be associated with vulnerability to psychosis.},

Twelve children and 12 adults (average age = 10.2 and 26.1 years, respectively) reported whether short phrases described themselves or a highly familiar other (Harry Potter) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. In both children and adults, the MPFC was relatively more active during self- than social knowledge retrieval, and the MPPC was relatively more active during social than self-knowledge retrieval. Direct comparisons between children and adults indicated that children activated the MPFC during self-knowledge retrieval to a much greater extent than adults. The particular regions of the MPPC involved varied between the two groups, with the posterior precuneus engaged by adults, but the anterior precuneus and posterior cingulate engaged by children. Only children activated the MPFC significantly above baseline during self-knowledge retrieval.

  abstract = {Postmortem studies have revealed reduced densities of dendritic spines in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of subjects with schizophrenia. However, the molecular mechanisms that might contribute to these alterations are unknown. Recent studies of the intracellular signals that regulate spine dynamics have identified members of the RhoGTPase family (e.g., Cdc42, Rac1, RhoA) as critical regulators of spine structure. In addition, Duo and drebrin are spine-specific proteins that are critical for spine maintenance and spine formation, respectively. In order to determine whether the mRNA expression levels of Cdc42, Rac1, RhoA, Duo or drebrin are altered in schizophrenia, tissue sections containing DLPFC area 9 from 15 matched pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects were processed for in situ hybridization. Expression levels of these mRNAs were also correlated with DLPFC spine density in a subset of the same subjects. In order to assess the potential influence of antipsychotic medications on the expression of these mRNAs, similar studies were conducted in monkeys chronically exposed to haloperidol or olanzapine. The expression of each of these mRNAs was lower in the gray matter of the subjects with schizophrenia compared to the control subjects, although only the reductions in Cdc42 and Duo remained significant after corrections for multiple comparisons. In addition, spine density was strongly correlated with the expression levels of both Duo (r=0.73, P=0.007) and Cdc42 (r=0.71, P=0.009) mRNAs. In contrast, the expression levels of Cdc42 and Duo mRNAs were not altered in monkeys chronically exposed to antipsychotic medications. In conclusion, reduced expression of Cdc42 and Duo mRNAs may represent molecular mechanisms that contribute to the decreased density of dendritic spines in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia.},

We examined the role of the schizophrenia risk factor DISC1 in the maintenance of spine morphology and function. We found that DISC1 anchored Kalirin-7 (Kal-7), regulating access of Kal-7 to Rac1 and controlling the duration and intensity of Rac1 activation in response to NMDA receptor activation in both cortical cultures and rat brain in vivo. These results explain why Rac1 and its activator (Kal-7) serve as important mediators of spine enlargement and why constitutive Rac1 activation decreases spine size. This mechanism likely underlies disturbances in glutamatergic neurotransmission that have been frequently reported in schizophrenia that can lead to alteration of dendritic spines with consequential major pathological changes in brain function. Furthermore, the concept of a signalosome involving disease-associated factors, such as DISC1 and glutamate, may well contribute to the multifactorial and polygenetic characteristics of schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Synapses are specialized cell-cell contacts that mediate communication between neurons. Most excitatory synapses in the brain are housed on dendritic spines, small actin-rich protrusions extending from dendrites. During development and in response to environmental stimuli, spines undergo marked changes in shape and number thought to underlie processes like learning and memory. Improper spine development, in contrast, likely impedes information processing in the brain, since spine abnormalities are associated with numerous brain disorders. Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the formation and plasticity of spines and their resident synapses is therefore crucial to our understanding of cognition and disease. Rho-family GTPases, key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, play essential roles in orchestrating the development and remodeling of spines and synapses. Precise spatio-temporal regulation of Rho GTPase activity is critical for their function, since aberrant Rho GTPase signaling can cause spine and synapse defects as well as cognitive impairments. Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inhibited by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We propose that Rho-family GEFs and GAPs provide the spatiotemporal regulation and signaling specificity necessary for proper Rho GTPase function based on the following features they possess: (i) existence of multiple GEFs and GAPs per Rho GTPase, (ii) developmentally regulated expression, (iii) discrete localization, (iv) ability to bind to and organize specific signaling networks, and (v) tightly regulated activity, perhaps involving GEF/GAP interactions. Recent studies describe several Rho-family GEFs and GAPs that uniquely contribute to spinogenesis and synaptogenesis. Here, we highlight several of these proteins and discuss how they occupy distinct biochemical niches critical for synaptic development.},

The largest number of supranumerary synapses has been recorded in the cerebral cortex of human and nonhuman primates. It is generally accepted that synaptic pruning in the cerebral cortex, including prefrontal areas, occurs at puberty and is completed during early adolescence [Huttenlocher PR, et al. (1979) Brain Res 163:195\textendash{}205]. In the present study we analyzed synaptic spine density on the dendrites of layer IIIC cortico\textendash{}cortical and layer V cortico\textendash{}subcortical projecting pyramidal neurons in a large sample of human prefrontal cortices in subjects ranging in age from newborn to 91 y. We confirm that dendritic spine density in childhood exceeds adult values by two- to threefold and begins to decrease during puberty. However, we also obtained evidence that overproduction and developmental remodeling, including substantial elimination of synaptic spines, continues beyond adolescence and throughout the third decade of life before stabilizing at the adult level. Such an extraordinarily long phase of developmental reorganization of cortical neuronal circuitry has implications for understanding the effect of environmental impact on the development of human cognitive and emotional capacities as well as the late onset of human-specific neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Previous investigations have combined transcriptional and genetic analyses in human cell lines, but few have applied these techniques to human neural tissue. To gain a global molecular perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical development, function and ageing, we explore the temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription in human prefrontal cortex in an extensive series of post-mortem brains from fetal development through ageing. We discover a wave of gene expression changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in neurodegeneration. Although we identify thousands of robust associations of individual genetic polymorphisms with gene expression, we also demonstrate that there is no association between the total extent of genetic differences between subjects and the global similarity of their transcriptional profiles. Hence, the human genome produces a consistent molecular architecture in the prefrontal cortex, despite millions of genetic differences across individuals and races. To enable further discovery, this entire data set is freely available (from Gene Expression Omnibus: accession GSE30272; and dbGaP: accession phs000417.v1.p1) and can also be interrogated via a biologist-friendly stand-alone application (http://www.libd.org/braincloud).},

  abstract = {Self-disturbances (SDs) are increasingly identified in schizophrenia and are theorized to confer vulnerability to psychosis. Neuroimaging research has shed some light on the neural correlates of SDs in schizophrenia. But, the onset and trajectory of the neural alterations underlying SDs in schizophrenia remain incompletely understood. We hypothesize that the aberrant structure and function of brain areas (e.g., prefrontal, lateral temporal, and parietal cortical structures) comprising the ``neural circuitry of self'' may represent an early, premorbid (i.e., pre-prodromal) indicator of schizophrenia risk. Consistent with neurodevelopmental models, we argue that ``early'' (i.e., perinatal) dysmaturational processes (e.g., abnormal cortical neural cell migration and mini-columnar formation) affecting key prefrontal (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex), lateral temporal cortical (e.g., superior temporal sulcus), parietal (e.g., inferior parietal lobule) structures involved in self-processing may lead to subtle disruptions of ``self'' during childhood in persons at risk for schizophrenia. During adolescence, progressive neurodevelopmental alterations (e.g., aberrant synaptic pruning) affecting the neural circuitry of self may contribute to worsening of SDs. This could result in the emergence of prodromal symptoms and, eventually, full-blown psychosis. To highlight why adolescence may be a period of heightened risk for SDs, we first summarize the literature regarding the neural correlates of self in typically developing children. Next, we present evidence from neuroimaging studies in genetic high-risk youth suggesting that fronto-temporal-parietal structures mediating self-reflection may be abnormal in the premorbid period. Our goal is that the ideas presented here might provide future directions for research into the neurobiology of SDs during the pre-psychosis development of youth at risk for schizophrenia.},

Anomalies of self-experience are grouped according the experiential domain that appears to be affected and are illustrated by short vignettes or verbatim quotes from the patients. It is suggested that disorders of the self deserve further systematic empirical investigations, also from an etiological perspective. Self-disorders may turn out to be potentially useful as a psychopathological organizer of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

Development, glial-neural interaction, changes in energy homeostasis, diverse genetic predisposition, neuroimmune processes and environmental influences all can tip the delicate homeostatic balance of the synaptic morphology and connectivity in a uniquely individual fashion, thus contributing to the emergence of the various symptoms of this devastating disorder.

  abstract = {Background~
The pathophysiological characteristics of schizophrenia appear to involve altered synaptic connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Given the central role that layer 3 pyramidal neurons play in corticocortical and thalamocortical connectivity, we hypothesized that the excitatory inputs to these neurons are altered in subjects with schizophrenia.Methods
To test this hypothesis, we determined the density of dendritic spines, markers of excitatory inputs, on the basilar dendrites of Golgi-impregnated pyramidal neurons in the superficial and deep portions of layer 3 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 46) and in layer 3 of the primary visual cortex (area 17) of 15 schizophrenic subjects, 15 normal control subjects, and 15 nonschizophrenic subjects with a psychiatric illness (referred to as psychiatric subjects).Results
There was a significant effect of diagnosis on spine density only for deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons in area 46 (P = .006). In the schizophrenic subjects, spine density on these neurons was decreased by 23\% and 16\% compared with the normal control (P = .004) and psychiatric (P = .08) subjects, respectively. In contrast, spine density on neurons in superficial layer 3 in area 46 (P = .09) or in area 17 (P = .08) did not significantly differ across the 3 subject groups. Furthermore, spine density on deep layer 3 neurons in area 46 did not significantly (P = .81) differ between psychiatric subjects treated with antipsychotic agents and normal controls.Conclusion
This region- and disease-specific decrease in dendritic spine density on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex layer 3 pyramidal cells is consistent with the hypothesis that the number of cortical and/or thalamic excitatory inputs to these neurons is altered in subjects with schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Background
Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe psychiatric diseases with overlapping symptomatology. Widespread brain morphologic abnormalities, including cortical thinning and subcortical volume reductions, have been demonstrated in schizophrenia but it is unclear whether similar abnormalities are present in bipolar disorder. The purpose of this study was to compare cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, to assess differences and similarities in cortical and subcortical brain structure.
Methods
We analyzed magnetic resonance images from a sample of 173 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 139 patients with bipolar disorder, and 207 healthy control subjects. Cortical thickness was compared between the groups in multiple locations across the continuous cortical surface. Subcortical volumes were compared on a structure-by-structure basis.
Results
There was widespread cortical thinning in schizophrenia compared with control subjects, in frontal, temporal, occipital, and smaller parietal regions. There was no cortical thinning in bipolar disorder compared with control subjects or in schizophrenia compared with bipolar disorder. However, the subgroup of patients with bipolar disorder Type 1 showed cortical thinning, primarily in the frontal lobes and superior temporal and temporoparietal regions. Both patient groups showed substantial subcortical volume reductions bilaterally in the hippocampus, the left thalamus, the right nucleus accumbens, the left cerebellar cortex, and the brainstem, along with substantial ventricular enlargements.
Conclusions
We found substantial overlap in the underlying brain morphologic abnormalities in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in subcortical structures, and between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Type 1 in the cerebral cortex.},

We identify 128 independent associations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Background
Persistent formal thought disorder (FTD) is one of the most characteristic features of schizophrenia. Several neuroimaging studies report spatially distinct neuroanatomical changes in association with FTD. Given that most studies so far have employed a univariate localisation approach that obscures the study of covarying interregional relationships, the present study focussed on the multivariate systemic pattern of anatomical changes that contribute to FTD.
Methods
Speech samples from nineteen medicated clinically stable schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls were evaluated for subtle formal thought disorder. Ultra high-field (7 T) anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans were obtained from all subjects. Multivariate morphometric patterns were identified using an independent component approach (source based morphometry). Using multiple regression analysis, the morphometric patterns predicting positive and negative FTD scores were identified.
Results
Morphometric variations in grey matter predicted a substantial portion of inter-individual variance in negative but not positive FTD. A pattern of concomitant striato-insular/precuneus reduction along with frontocingular grey matter increase had a significant association with negative FTD.
Conclusions
These results suggest that concomitant increase and decrease in grey matter occur in association with persistent negative thought disorder in clinically stable individuals with schizophrenia.},

From a neurobiological point of view, they are of particular interest since both can be attributed to the language domain of human communication. In the last decade, brain imaging studies have contributed to the understanding of the functional dynamics underlying these phenomena. In particular, auditory hallucinations were found to involve the regions generating inner speech as well as the primary acoustical cortex and the intrahemispheric fiber bundles connecting the left frontal with the temporal lobe. In patients with formal thought disorders, on the other hand, the left temporal language area showed structural deficits and functional abnormalities, i.e., reduced reactivity to stimulation and increased activity at rest; left frontal language regions were also hyperactive at rest but showed no structural deficits. The available evidence indicates a dynamic imbalance of the language system, triggered by subtle structural changes, as the possible common neurobiological basis of hallucinations and formal thought disorders.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.schres.2010.01.024},
  abstract = {Background
Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) and formal thought disorder (FTD) may originate from the same aberration in the language system. The hypothesis of a shared neurobiological basis would be strengthened by the presence of FTD in individuals who frequently experience AVH, but do not meet DSM-IV criteria for a psychotic disorder.
Methods
In this study, FTD was quantified in 40 non-clinical subjects with AVH, in 50 healthy subjects without AVH and in 40 schizophrenia patients with AVH. Recorded speech samples were analysed by one rater who was blind to the presence/absence of AVH and to diagnosis, using the Thought and Language Index.
Results
Negative FTD was barely present in non-clinical subjects with AVH and in healthy controls without AVH. Positive FTD, however, was significantly higher in both groups experiencing AVH than in controls without AVH. Severity of positive FTD did not differ significantly between non-clinical subjects with AVH and schizophrenia patients with AVH.
Conclusion
Negative FTD (alogia) appears not to be associated with AVH. However, the fact that positive FTD (disorganised speech) in schizophrenia patients with AVH is equally high in non-clinical subjects with AVH indicates that these two symptoms tend to co-occur, which may be suggestive of a shared neurobiological substrate.},

It is based on the 4-volume treatise, Handbook of the Cerebellum and Cerebellar Disorders (Springer, 2013), the definitive reference for scientists and neurologists in the field of cerebellar neurobiology. There have been fundamental advances in the basic science and clinical neurology of the cerebellum and its role in sensorimotor function and cognition. This monograph makes this large and expanding body of knowledge readily accessible to trainees and clinicians alike. The editors are world leaders in the field, and the chapters are authored by an international panel of experts drawn from ataxia clinics and cerebellar laboratories throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Essentials provides a solid grounding in the field of cerebellar research and ataxiology from cerebellar circuity to clinical practice, and it serves as a springboard to a deeper appreciation of both the principles and the complexities of cerebellar neurobiology. Clinicians are expected to have a deep appreciation of cerebellar disorders, not only in specialized ataxia clinics but also in adult and pediatric neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and neuropsychology practices, and in outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation settings. This book is an indispensable resource for students and practitioners navigating the evolving field of cerebellar motor and cognitive neurology. It also links to the more expansive Handbook for those who need to explore the topics in this monograph in greater depth.},

Previous research has demonstrated deficits in such sensory-predictive processes in schizophrenic patients and these low-level deficits are thought to contribute to the emergence of delusions of control. Here, we examined the extent to which individual differences in sensory prediction are associated with a tendency towards delusional ideation in healthy participants. We used a force-matching task to quantify sensory-predictive processes, and administered questionnaires to assess schizotypy and delusion-like thinking. Individuals with higher levels of delusional ideation showed more accurate force matching suggesting that such thinking is associated with a reduced tendency to predict and attenuate the sensory consequences of self-generated actions. These results suggest that deficits in sensory prediction in schizophrenia are not simply consequences of the deluded state and are not related to neuroleptic medication. Rather they appear to be stable, trait-like characteristics of an individual, a finding that has important implications for our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of delusions.},

  abstract = {The experience of agency, i.e., the registration that I am the initiator of my actions, is a basic and constant underpinning of our interaction with the world. Whereas several accounts have underlined predictive processes as the central mechanism (e.g., the comparator model by C. Frith), others emphasized postdictive inferences (e.g., post-hoc inference account by D. Wegner). Based on increasing evidence that both predictive and postdictive processes contribute to the experience of agency, we here present a unifying but at the same time parsimonious approach that reconciles these accounts: predictive and postdictive processes are both integrated by the brain according to the principles of optimal cue integration. According to this framework, predictive and postdictive processes each serve as authorship cues that are continuously integrated and weighted depending on their availability and reliability in a given situation. Both sensorimotor and cognitive signals can serve as predictive cues (e.g., internal predictions based on an efferency copy of the motor command or cognitive anticipations based on priming). Similarly, other sensorimotor and cognitive cues can each serve as post-hoc cues (e.g., visual feedback of the action or the affective valence of the action outcome). Integration and weighting of these cues might not only differ between contexts and individuals, but also between different subject and disease groups. For example, schizophrenia patients with delusions of influence seem to rely less on (probably imprecise) predictive motor signals of the action and more on post-hoc action cues like e.g., visual feedback and, possibly, the affective valence of the action outcome. Thus, the framework of optimal cue integration offers a promising approach that directly stimulates a wide range of experimentally testable hypotheses on agency processing in different subject groups.},

However, studies focusing on the perceptual awareness of our own actions during motor adaptation are still rare. Here we present the first simultaneous investigation of sensorimotor adaptation on both levels, i.e., action and action perception. We hypothesized that self-action perception relies on internal predictions about the sensory action outcome that are updated in a way similar to that of motor control. Twenty human subjects performed out-and-back pointing movements that were fed back visually. Feedback was initially presented in spatiotemporal correspondence with respect to the actual finger position, but later rotated by a constant angle. When distorted feedback was applied repetitively, subjects' perceived pointing direction shifted in the direction of the trajectory rotation. A comparable perceptual reinterpretation was observed in control trials without visual feedback, indicating that subjects learned to predict the new visual outcome of their actions based on nonvisual, internal information. The perception of the world, however, remained unchanged. The changes in perception of one's own movements were accompanied by adaptive changes in motor performance of the same amount, i.e., a secondary motor compensation opposite to the direction of the imposed visual rotation. Our results show that the perception of one's own actions depends on adaptable internal predictions about the sensory action outcome, allowing us to attribute new sensory consequences of our actions to our own agency. Furthermore, they indicate that the updated sensory prediction can be used to optimize motor control.},

We present the case of a patient who developed lithium toxicity with normal therapeutic levels, as a result of pharmacokinetic interaction with Valsartan, and probable Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome from the ensuing lithium toxicity. Case Presentation. A 59-year old black male with bipolar disorder maintained on lithium and fluphenazine therapy presented with a 2 week history of worsening confusion, tremor, and gait abnormality. He recently had his dose of Valsartan increased. At presentation, patient had signs of autonomic instability, he was confused, dehydrated, and had rigidity of upper extremities. Significant labs on admission were lithium level-1.2, elevated CK-6008, leukocytosis WBC-22, and renal impairment; Creatinine-4.1, BUN-35, HCO3-20.1, and blood glucose 145. CT/MRI brain showed old cerebral infarcts, and there was no evidence of an infective process. Lithium and fluphenazine were discontinued, his lithium levels gradually decreased, and he improved with supportive treatment including rehydration and correction of electrolyte imbalance. Conclusions. This case illustrates that lithium toxicity can occur within therapeutic levels, and the neurotoxic effect of lithium can include Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of the risk associated with drug interactions with lithium.},

  abstract = {Male Wistar rats received a single stomach load (10 ml/kg) of a 150 mmol LiCl solution, either alone or together with tetracycline (33.5 mg/10 ml), ampicillin (33.5 mg/10 ml), or metronidazole (15 mg/10 ml). Urine was collected 1-5 hours after administration and blood samples were drawn after 1, 6, and 24 hours. All antibiotics caused a reduction in urinary lithium excretion but did not affect renal lithium clearance. Serum lithium levels were reduced by tetracycline and metronidazole 6 hours after administration but increased after 24 hours. Additional experiments including frequent mapping of serum lithium levels confirmed these findings. Tetracycline, also reduced renal sodium clearance and increased distal sodium reabsorption. Short-term daily treatment during one week with tetracycline or metronidazole showed that these initial changes were only transient, since after treatment for one week no differences could be observed between antibiotic-treated rats and control rats. The results indicate that antibiotics may cause a delay but no decrease of the gastrointestinal absorption of lithium and that they do not affect renal lithium clearance. Signs of lithium intoxication during combined use of lithium and antibiotics are therefore probably not caused by a renal interaction mechanism affecting the renal lithium clearance.},

  abstract = {Objective:\hspace{0.6em} Lithium is a drug with a narrow therapeutic window. Concomitantly used medication is a potentially influencing factor of lithium serum concentrations. We conducted a multicentre retrospective case-control study with the aim of investigating lithium-related drug interactions as determinants of elevated lithium serum levels in daily clinical practice. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Cases were patients with an increase of at least 50\% in lithium serum concentrations resulting in an elevated lithium serum level of at least 1.3~mmol/L, and who were not suspected of a suicide attempt. Controls were patients who showed stable lithium serum levels within the therapeutic range. Use and start of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, renin\textendash{}angiotensin inhibitors, theophyllin and antibiotics were investigated as potential determinants of the elevated lithium serum levels. Irregularity in lithium dispensing pattern, change in lithium dosing regimen, age, gender, prescribing physician and laboratory parameters were investigated as potential confounders. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We included 51 cases and 51 controls in our study. Five (9.8\%) controls and 15 (29.4\%) cases used potentially interacting co-medication [OR of 3.83 (95\%CI 1.28\textendash{}11.48)]. Start of potentially interacting co-medication was observed in eight (15.7\%) cases and in zero (0\%) controls resulting in an OR of 20.13 (95\% CI 1.13\textendash{}359). After adjustment for co-medication, irregularity in lithium dispensing pattern, change in lithium dosing regimen, and age, the statistically significant association was lost. We report an OR of 2.70 (95\% CI 0.78\textendash{}9.31) for use of concomitant medication, with a large contribution of antibiotic agents, and an OR of 3.14 (95\% CI 1.15\textendash{}8.61) for irregularity in lithium dispensing pattern. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Use of co-medication, especially antibiotics, tends to be associated with elevated lithium serum levels.},

C. botulinum elaborates eight antigenically distinguishable exotoxins (A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F and G). All serotypes interfere with neural transmission by blocking the release of acetylcholine, the principal neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle paralysis. The weakness induced by injection with botulinum toxin A usually lasts about three months. Botulinum toxins now play a very significant role in the management of a wide variety of medical conditions, especially strabismus and focal dystonias, hemifacial spasm, and various spastic movement disorders, headaches, hypersalivation, hyperhidrosis, and some chronic conditions that respond only partially to medical treatment. The list of possible new indications is rapidly expanding. The cosmetological applications include correction of lines, creases and wrinkling all over the face, chin, neck, and chest to dermatological applications such as hyperhidrosis. Injections with botulinum toxin are generally well tolerated and side effects are few. A precise knowledge and understanding of the functional anatomy of the mimetic muscles is absolutely necessary to correctly use botulinum toxins in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Several neuropsychiatric conditions, such as addiction and schizophrenia, may arise in part from dysregulated activity of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic (THVTA) neurons, as well as from more global maladaptation in neurocircuit function. However, whether THVTA activity affects large-scale brain-wide function remains unknown. Here we selectively activated THVTA neurons in transgenic rats and measured resulting changes in whole-brain activity using stimulus-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging. Applying a standard generalized linear model analysis approach, our results indicate that selective optogenetic stimulation of THVTA neurons enhanced cerebral blood volume signals in striatal target regions in a dopamine receptor-dependent manner. However, brain-wide voxel-based principal component analysis of the same data set revealed that dopaminergic modulation activates several additional anatomically distinct regions throughout the brain, not typically associated with dopamine release events. Furthermore, explicit pairing of THVTA neuronal activation with a forepaw stimulus of a particular frequency expanded the sensory representation of that stimulus, not exclusively within the somatosensory cortices, but brain-wide. These data suggest that modulation of THVTA neurons can impact brain dynamics across many distributed anatomically distinct regions, even those that receive little to no direct THVTA input.},

  abstract = {Food resources contaminated with spoilage or pathogenic microorganisms pose severe problems to all higher organisms. Here, we describe a food-hygienic strategy of the emerald cockroach wasp Ampulex compressa. The wasp larvae develop on and inside the American cockroach Periplaneta americana, a host that can harbor various putrefactive microbes, as well as human and insect pathogens. From P. americana, we isolated the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens, which is a potent entomopathogen that can rapidly kill insect larvae. It is also known as a food contaminant and as an opportunistic human pathogen. Using behavioral observations and chemical analyses, we demonstrated that A. compressa larvae impregnate their cockroach hosts from inside with large amounts of an oral secretion containing a blend of $\gamma$-lactones and isocoumarins with (R)-(-)-mellein [(R)-(-)-3,4-diydro-8-hydroxy-3-methylisocoumarin] and micromolide [(4R,9Z)-octadec-9-en-4-olide] as dominant components. We fractionated hexane extracts of the secretion and investigated the antimicrobial properties of the fraction containing the lactones and isocoumarins, as well as of synthetic (R)-(-)-mellein and micromolide, against S. marcescens and a Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus hyicus, in broth microdilution assays. The test fraction inhibited growth of both tested bacteria. The activity of the fraction against S. marcescens was explained by (R)-(-)-mellein alone, and the activity against S. hyicus was explained by the combined action of (R)-(-)-mellein and micromolide. Our data suggest that the specific combination of antimicrobials in the larval secretion provides an effective frontline defense against the unpredictable spectrum of microbes that A. compressa larvae may encounter during their development inside their cockroach hosts.},

But who were the early speakers of this ancient mother tongue, and how did they manage to spread it around the globe? Until now their identity has remained a tantalizing mystery to linguists, archaeologists, and even Nazis seeking the roots of the Aryan race. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language lifts the veil that has long shrouded these original Indo-European speakers, and reveals how their domestication of horses and use of the wheel spread language and transformed civilization.  Linking prehistoric archaeological remains with the development of language, David Anthony identifies the prehistoric peoples of central Eurasia's steppe grasslands as the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European, and shows how their innovative use of the ox wagon, horseback riding, and the warrior's chariot turned the Eurasian steppes into a thriving transcontinental corridor of communication, commerce, and cultural exchange. He explains how they spread their traditions and gave rise to important advances in copper mining, warfare, and patron-client political institutions, thereby ushering in an era of vibrant social change. Anthony also describes his fascinating discovery of how the wear from bits on ancient horse teeth reveals the origins of horseback riding.  The Horse, the Wheel, and Language solves a puzzle that has vexed scholars for two centuries--the source of the Indo-European languages and English--and recovers a magnificent and influential civilization from the past.},

Yet zombies behave just like us, and some even spend a lot oftime discussing consciousness., Few people, if any, think zombies actually exist. But many hold theyare at least conceivable, and some that they are possible. It seemsthat if zombies really are possible, then physicalism is false andsome kind of dualism is true. For many philosophers that is the chiefimportance of the zombie idea. But it is also valuable for the sharpfocus it gives to philosophical theorizing about consciousness (forexample Howell 2013; Kriegel 2011; Stoljar 2006; Tye 2008). Use of thezombie idea against physicalism also raises more general questionsabout the relations between imaginability, conceivability, andpossibility.

The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha is the foremost example of this work. All the important documents (sixty-five in all, published in two separate volumes) from the period between the Old and the New Testaments have been collected in this landmark work. The foremost international authority on each book has been selected to contribute a new translation (sometimes for the first time), an introduction, and critical notes for each of the texts, with all work taking advantage of the very latest in scriptural scholarship.These texts are of great value to all people whose religious heritage focuses on the Bible for insight into the development of doctrine. By studying the pseudepigrapha, we can increase our knowledge of the beginnings of the Christian religion, as well as the development of Judaism after the close of the Hebrew Bible.Scholars, Bible students, professionals of all religious groups and denominations, and lay people---indeed, all those who can be signified as "People of the Book:" Christians, Jews, Mormons, Muslims---will be interested in these translations.The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha is truly a work of international importance, and Hendrickson Publishers is pleased to offer it in this economical paperback edition.},

After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to:, 1. Assess anomalous self-experience as a core feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders., 2. Evaluate current and historical research regarding disorders of self-experience in schizophrenia.

Abstract
This article explores the phenomenological and empirical rediscovery of anomalous self-experience as a core feature of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders and presents the current status of research in this field. Historically, a disordered self was considered to be a constitutive phenotype of schizophrenia. Although the notion of a disordered self has continued to appear occasionally over the years\textemdash{}mainly in the phenomenologically or psychodynamically oriented literature\textemdash{}this notion was usually considered as a theoretical construct rather than as referring to concretely lived anomalous experiences. Empirical research on the disorders of self-experience in schizophrenia can be traced back to the US-Denmark psychopathological collaboration in the well-known adoption and high-risk studies, which aimed at identifying trait or phenotypic vulnerability features. This research was later followed by clinical work with first-admission schizophrenia patients. We offer clinical descriptions of anomalous self-experience and outline the phenomenological structures of subjectivity that are needed for grasping the nature of these anomalous experiential phenomena. What appears to underlie these experiences is an instability of the first-person perspective that threatens the basic experience of being a self-coinciding, embodied, demarcated, and persisting subject of awareness. We summarize a series of empirical studies targeting self-experience in schizophrenia performed prior to and after the construction of a phenomenologically oriented psychometric instrument for assessing anomalies of self-experience, the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE). These empirical studies support the classic clinical intuition that anomalous self-experiences form a central phenotype of schizophrenia. Implications for diagnosis and research are briefly discussed.},

Among the topics discussed are questions like 'What is a self?, ' 'What is the relation between the self-givenness of consciousness and the givenness of the conscious self?', 'How should we understand the self-disorders encountered in schizophrenia?' and 'What general insights into the nature of the self can pathological phenomena provide us with?' Most of the contributions are characterized by a distinct phenomenological approach.The chapters by Butterworth, Strawson, Zahavi, and Marbach are general in nature and address different psychological and philosophical aspects of what it means to be a self. Next Eilan, Parnas, and Sass turn to schizophrenia and ask both how we should approach and understand this disorder, and, more specifically, what we can learn about the nature of selfhood and existence from psychopathology. The chapters by Blakemore and Gallagher present a defense and a criticism of the so-called model of self-monitoring, respectively. The final three chapters by Cutting, Stanghellini, Schwartz and Wiggins represent anthropologically oriented attempts to situate pathologies of self-experience.(Series B)},

Doctors believed that ninety percent of insanity cases were curable, but only if treated outside the home, in large-scale buildings. Nineteenth-century psychiatrists considered the architecture of asylums, especially their planning, to be one of the most powerful tools for the treatment of the insane, targeting social as well as biological factors to facilitate the treatment of mental illnesses. The construction and usage of these quasi-public buildings served to legitimize developing ideas in psychiatry. About 300 psychiatric hospitals, known at the time as insane asylums or colloquially as ``loony bins'' or ``nuthouses,'' were constructed in the United States before 1900. Asylum architecture is notable for the way similar floor plans were built in a wide range of architectural styles.},

General principles of the organization of these circuits and their control by higher brain centers have come from the study of smaller circuits found in invertebrates. Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuro-modulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

\item 

The fundamental variables of small-molecule\textendash{}neuropeptide co-transmission, including the potential degrees of freedom at particular presynaptic and postsynaptic profiles, and the impact of presynaptic neuron firing rate, modulatory state and extracellular peptidase activity, act to increase the complexity of synaptic transmission.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

There is considerable diversity in the consequences for synaptic transmission resulting from small-molecule\textendash{}neuropeptide co-transmission at identified synapses, and their impact on behaviour. One highlight is that the various mechanisms by which this co-transmission influences synapses (for example, convergent or divergent co-transmission, firing rate-dependent co-transmitter release, and so on) are shared across invertebrate and vertebrate species.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Using exogenously applied neuropeptides has provided many insights into their modulatory actions, but this approach also has limitations and can lead to erroneous conclusions, as illustrated by studies in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion that compare the influence of exogenous versus neuronally released neuropeptides from identified neurons.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Extending small-molecule\textendash{}neuropeptide co-transmission studies from individual synapses to their impact on microcircuits, results from the crustacean stomatogastric system are presented to elucidate the impact of convergent versus divergent co-transmission, to separate regulation of co-transmitters and to show the distinct influence on the same microcircuits of different neurons with shared co-transmitters.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Work from the stomatogastric system is also used to provide insight regarding the imperfect match between the influence of apparently equivalent, small-molecule\textendash{}neuropeptide co-transmitting neurons on the same microcircuits in different species.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$$<$/ul$>$$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Degeneracy, the ability of elements that are structurally different to perform the same function, is a prominent property of many biological systems ranging from genes to neural networks to evolution itself. Because structurally different elements may produce different outputs in different contexts, degeneracy should be distinguished from redundancy, which occurs when the same function is performed by identical elements. However, because of ambiguities in the distinction between structure and function and because of the lack of a theoretical treatment, these two notions often are conflated. By using information theoretical concepts, we develop here functional measures of the degeneracy and redundancy of a system with respect to a set of outputs. These measures help to distinguish the concept of degeneracy from that of redundancy and make it operationally useful. Through computer simulations of neural systems differing in connectivity, we show that degeneracy is low both for systems in which each element affects the output independently and for redundant systems in which many elements can affect the output in a similar way but do not have independent effects. By contrast, degeneracy is high for systems in which many different elements can affect the output in a similar way and at the same time can have independent effects. We demonstrate that networks that have been selected for degeneracy have high values of complexity, a measure of the average mutual information between the subsets of a system. These measures promise to be useful in characterizing and understanding the functional robustness and adaptability of biological networks.},

We now report that proctolin depolarizes these cells maximally at membrane potentials close to the threshold for action potential generation. In voltage clamp, proctolin evokes an inward current, carried at least partially by Na+, that shows strong outward rectification. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ markedly increases the amplitude of the proctolin-evoked current and linearizes its current-voltage curve.

One of these peptides, proctolin, activates an inward current that shows strong outward rectification (Golowasch and Marder, 1992). Decreasing the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration linearizes the current-voltage curve of the proctolin-induced current. We used voltage clamp to study the currents evoked by proctolin and five additional modulators [C. borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia), crustacean cardioactive peptide, red pigment-concentrating hormone, TNRNFLRFamide, and the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine] in stomatogastric ganglion neurons, both in the intact ganglion and in dissociated cell culture. Subtraction currents yielded proctolin-like current-voltage relationships for all six substances, and the current-voltage curves of all six substances showed linearization in low external Ca(2+). The lateral pyloric neuron responded to all six modulators, but the ventricular dilator neuron only responded to a subset of them. Bath application of saturating concentrations of proctolin occluded the response to CabTRP and vice versa. N-(6-Aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-napthalensulfonamide, a calmodulin inhibitor, increased the amplitude and altered the voltage dependence of the responses elicited by CabTRP and proctolin. Together, these data indicate that all six substances converge onto the same voltage-dependent current, although they activate different receptors. Therefore, differential network responses evoked by these substances may primarily depend on the receptor distribution on network neurons.},

We show here that each of these modulators acts on a distinct subset of pyloric network neurons in the STG. To ask whether the differences in cell targets could account for their differential effects on the pyloric rhythm, we systematically compared the motor patterns produced by proctolin and CCAP. The motor patterns produced in proctolin and CCAP differed quantitatively in a number of ways. Proctolin and CCAP both act on the lateral pyloric neuron and the inferior cardiac neuron. Proctolin additionally acts on the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, the pyloric (PY) neurons, and the ventricular dilator neuron. Using the dynamic clamp, we introduced an artificial peptide-elicited current into the PD and PY neurons, in the presence of CCAP, and converted the CCAP rhythm into a rhythm that was statistically similar to that seen in proctolin. This suggests that the differences in the network effects of these two modulators can primarily be attributed to the known differential distributions of their receptors onto distinct subsets of neurons, despite the fact that they activate the same current.},

  abstract = {The Neuromodulatory Inward Current (IMI) of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) in Cancer borealis is an inward difference current elicited by neuromodulators whose current voltage relation (IV curve) has been shown to be crucial to transitioning the pyloric network of this system from non-oscillating to oscillating states. Here, models of the second messenger signaling of both this current's activation and voltage dependence are constructed and tested. First, we examine how the proctolin receptor activates IMI with the hypothesis that it signals through an intermediate signaling component. This is tested by bath application and pressure injection of agonists and antagonists of second messenger systems and examining their effect on neuromodulator induced IMI. Consistent with this hypothesis, it is found that this proctolin-induced IMI is sensitive to modulators of G-protein function. Also consistent with this hypothesis, it is found that proctolin-induced IMI is sensitive to modulators of intracellular calcium concentration and calmodulin activated kinases. In contrast, there seems to be no effect to acute applications of pharmaceutical activators and inhibitors of cyclic nucleotides, Phospholipase C, and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Next, we examine the mechanism of IMI voltage dependence that has been shown to be dependent upon extracellular calcium level and calmodulin signaling which we show is necessary for IMI voltage dependence by finding that application of calmodulin antagonists in normal calcium reduces IMI voltage dependence. However, it is found that calmodulin activators do not rescue IMI voltage dependence in low calcium so we propose that a Calcium Sensitive Receptor (CaSR) maintains IMI voltage dependence by active detection of extracellular calcium. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence. First, IMI slope was increased by the specific calcium sensitive receptor antagonist NPS-2143 suggesting CaSR involvement. Second, IMI slope conductance was increased by exposure to the $\beta\gamma$-subunit inhibitor, gallein, suggesting that voltage dependence can be modulated by the $\beta\gamma$-subunit of trimeric g-proteins. Third, W7 induced linearization of IMI was reduced by pre-incubation of preparations with endocytosis inhibitors, suggesting that downregulation of a receptor is mediating W7 induced changes in IMI voltage dependence. Together, these results support the hypothesis that IMI voltage dependence is mediated at least in part by a CaSR-like G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR).},

  abstract = {We study the electrical activity patterns and the expression of conductances in adult stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neurons as a function of time in primary cell culture. When first plated in culture, these neurons had few active properties. After 1 d in culture they produced small action potentials that rapidly inactivated during maintained depolarization. After 2 d in culture they fired large action potentials tonically when depolarized, and their properties resembled very closely the properties of STG neurons pharmacologically isolated in the ganglion. After 3-4 d in culture, however, their electrical properties changed and they fired in bursts when depolarized. We characterized the currents expressed by these neurons in culture. They included two TTX-sensitive sodium currents, a calcium current, a delayed-rectifier-like current, a calcium-dependent potassium current, and two A-type currents. The changes in firing properties with time in culture were accompanied by an increase in inward and decrease in outward current densities. A single-compartment conductance-based model of an STG neuron was constructed by fitting the currents measured in the biological neurons. When the current densities in the model neuron were matched to those measured for the biological neurons in each activity state, the model neuron closely reproduced each state, indicating that the changes in current densities are sufficient to account for the changes in intrinsic properties. These data indicate that STG neurons isolated in culture change their intrinsic electrical properties by selectively adjusting the magnitudes of their ionic conductances.},

Fluctuations in temperature pose a problem to the nervous systems of poikilotherms because their body temperature follows the ambient temperature, thus affecting the temperature-dependent dynamics of various subcellular components that constitute neuronal circuits. In the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, the pyloric circuit produces a triphasic rhythm comprising the output of the pyloric dilator, lateral pyloric, and pyloric constrictor neurons. In vitro, the phase relationships of these neurons are maintained over a fourfold change in pyloric frequency as temperature increases from 7$^\circ$C to 23$^\circ$C. To determine whether these temperature effects are also found in intact crabs, in the presence of sensory feedback and neuromodulator-rich environments, we measured the temperature dependence of the pyloric frequency and phases in vivo by implanting extracellular electrodes into Cancer borealis and Cancer pagurus and shifting tank water temperature from 11$^\circ$C to 26$^\circ$C. Pyloric frequency in the intact crab increased significantly with temperature (Q10 = 2\textendash{}2.5), while pyloric phases were generally conserved. For a subset of the C. borealis experiments, animals were subsequently dissected and the stomatogastric ganglion subjected to a similar temperature ramp in vitro. We found that the maximal frequency attained at high temperatures in vivo is lower than it is under in vitro conditions. Our results demonstrate that, over a wide temperature range, the phases of the pyloric rhythm in vivo are generally preserved, but that the frequency range is more restricted than it is in vitro.},

Here, we show that the design principles used to achieve robustness dramatically influence whether robustness leads to evolvability. In simulation experiments, we find that purely redundant systems have remarkably low evolvability while degenerate, i.e. partially redundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude more evolvable. Surprisingly, the magnitude of observed variation in evolvability can neither be explained by differences in the size nor the topology of the neutral networks. This suggests that degeneracy, a ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an important enabler of natural evolution.

\item 

Robustness is a ubiquitous feature of biological systems. It ensures that specific functions of the system are maintained despite external and internal perturbations. System control, alternative (or fail-safe) mechanisms, modularity and decoupling are the underlying mechanisms that produce robustness.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Robustness facilitates the evolvability of complex dynamic systems. Evolution, given enough time, might select a robust trait that is tolerant against environmental perturbations. This interlinks the properties of robustness and evolvability. Robustness is ubiquitous in biological systems that have evolved.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

There are specific architectural requirements for robust and evolvable systems \textemdash{} genetic buffering, robust modules and bow-tie architecture. These architectural requirements are the basis for the system's robustness against environmental perturbations, but congruent with genetic perturbations; they facilitate generation of a flexible phenotype.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Systems that are robust involve intrinsic trade-offs. Enhanced robustness against certain perturbations has to be balanced by extreme fragility elsewhere. This robust yet fragile nature, predicted by the highly optimized tolerance (HOT) theory, is a fundamental property of the system that has been optimally designed or has evolved to cope with perturbations. There are also other trade-offs in the system's performance and resource demands.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Diseases can be thought of in terms of the exposed fragility of robust yet fragile systems. The design of effective countermeasures requires proper understanding of a system's behavioural and failure patterns. \emph{Diabetes mellitus}, cancer and HIV infection represent the typical failure of such a system that requires systematic countermeasures to control robustness of an epidemic state. Countermeasures include systematic intervention to control a system's dynamics, attack fragility or introduce decoys to re-establish control.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Developing a theory of biological robustness with a solid mathematical foundation that can realistically represent biological systems is a difficult challenge. Research into non-linear dynamics, control theory and non-equilibrium theory is urgently required, but it has to be careful to capture the essential structural complexity and heterogeneity of biological systems.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$$<$/ul$>$$<$/p$>$},

Moreover, the kinetics of ion channels, maximal conductances, and Ca2+ buffering each have independent temperature sensitivities, suggesting that the balance of biological parameters can be disturbed by even modest temperature changes. In stomatogastric ganglia of the crab Cancer borealis, the duty cycle of the bursting pacemaker kernel is highly robust between 7 and 23$^\circ$C (Rinberg et al., 2013). We examined how this might be achieved in a detailed conductance-based model in which exponential temperature sensitivities were given by Q10 parameters. We assessed the temperature robustness of this model across 125,000 random sets of Q10 parameters. To examine how robustness might be achieved across a variable population of animals, we repeated this analysis across six sets of maximal conductance parameters that produced similar activity at 11$^\circ$C. Many permissible combinations of maximal conductance and Q10 parameters were found over broad regions of parameter space and relatively few correlations among Q10s were observed across successful parameter sets. A significant portion of Q10 sets worked for at least 3 of the 6 maximal conductance sets ($\sim$11.1\%). Nonetheless, no Q10 set produced robust function across all six maximal conductance sets, suggesting that maximal conductance parameters critically contribute to temperature robustness. Overall, these results provide insight into principles of temperature robustness in neuronal oscillators.},

  abstract = {Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a role in many pathological conditions (e.g., cancer and heart disease). Recently, MMP-9 has been implicated in various aspects of brain functions (e.g., neuroplasticity and epileptogenesis) and thus, we hypothesized that MMP-9 gene may be associated with bipolar mood disorder. The study was performed on 416 patients with bipolar mood disorder, including 75 patients with bipolar II type of the illness, and in 558 healthy control persons. A functional -1562C/T polymorphism of the MMP-9 gene was genotyped in all subjects. Patients with bipolar mood disorder had significant preponderance of T allele versus C allele of 1562C/T polymorphism of the MMP-9 gene, compared to healthy control subjects. The higher frequency of T allele compared to healthy subjects was especially evident in a subgroup of patients with bipolar disorder, type II. The results may provide the first evidence for an involvement of the MMP-9 gene in the pathogenesis of bipolar mood disorder. They may also contribute to explaining genetic connection between bipolar mood disorder and some somatic illnesses. In the light of our results obtained with this polymorphism in schizophrenia, we speculate that the MMP-9 gene may be a common susceptibility gene to major psychoses with different allelic variants occurring in bipolar illness and schizophrenia.},

Melatonin is a well-documented time-keeping hormone that can entrain an individual's physiology and behavior to the day\textendash{}night cycle, though surprisingly little is known about its influence on the neural basis of social behavior, including vocalization. Male midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) produce several call types distinguishable by duration and by daily and seasonal cycles in their production. We investigated melatonin's influence on the known nocturnal- and breeding season-dependent increase in excitability of the midshipman's vocal network (VN) that directly patterns natural calls. VN output is readily recorded from the vocal nerve as a `fictive call'. Five days of constant light significantly increased stimulus threshold levels for calls electrically evoked from vocally active sites in the medial midbrain, supporting previous findings that light suppresses VN excitability, while 2-iodomelatonin (2-IMel; a melatonin analog) implantation decreased threshold. 2-IMel also increased fictive call duration evoked from medial sites as well as lateral midbrain sites that produced several-fold longer calls irrespective of photoregime or drug treatment. When stimulus intensity was incrementally increased, 2-IMel increased duration only at lateral sites, suggesting that melatonin action is stronger in the lateral midbrain. For animals receiving 5 days of constant darkness, known to increase VN excitability, systemic injections of either of two mammalian melatonin receptor antagonists increased threshold and decreased duration for calls evoked from medial sites. Our results demonstrate melatonin modulation of VN excitability and suggest that social context-dependent call types differing in duration may be determined by neuro-hormonal action within specific regions of a midbrain vocal-acoustic network.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jad.2012.07.019},
  abstract = {Background
Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is an enzyme implicated in a number of pathological conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased blood levels of MMP-9 were found in cancer, heart disease and migraine. Molecular-genetic studies demonstrated an association of functional polymorphism of MMP-9 gene with predisposition to schizophrenia and bipolar illness. In this first study of serum MMP-9 in psychiatric illness, we estimated it in patients with bipolar mood disorder both during depression or mania as well as during immediate remission after these episodes.
Methods
The study was performed on 54 in-patients with bipolar mood disorder (19 males, 35 females), aged 42$\pm$14 years. Thirty were studied during acute episode and immediate remission after depression, and 24 during acute episode and immediate remission after mania. The control group consisted of 29 subjects (15 males, 14 females) aged 40$\pm$11 years. Serum MMP-9 was estimated by ELISA.
Results
In patients with bipolar illness, a significant correlation of MMP-9 levels was obtained with age. Younger patients with depression (below or equal 45 years of age), both during acute episode and in remission after depression had significantly higher MMP-9 levels compared to those with acute episode and remission after mania and control subjects.
Limitations
Relatively small number of patients, who were receiving different antidepressant, antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs that might have influenced MMP-9 levels.
Conclusions
Increased levels of serum MMP-9 during depression in young patients may indicate this phenomenon as a possible biochemical marker for staging of bipolar disorder.},

Those voltage-dependent curves aggregate the concomitant activity of all ion channels in distinct timescales. They are shown to shape the current-voltage dynamical relationships that determine neuronal spiking. We propose an experimental protocol to measure dynamic input conductances in neurons. In addition, we provide a computational method to extract dynamic input conductances from arbitrary conductance-based models and to analyze their sensitivity to arbitrary parameters. We illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach for modulation, compensation, and robustness studies in a published neuron model based on data of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis.},

  abstract = {Membrane channels are subject to a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms that can be affected by activity. We present a model of a stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neuron in which several Ca2+-dependent pathways are used to regulate the maximal conductances of membrane currents in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of this type, the regulation and modification of maximal conductances by electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven voltage-dependent membrane currents and uses three Ca2+ sensors acting on different time scales. Starting from random initial conditions over a given range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active membrane currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity approximately 90\% of the time. In these models, the same pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal conductances, and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from the lateral pyloric neuron of the STG. If the electrical activity of the model neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to restore the original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the activity pattern is again restored after a transient adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to their initial values. The model suggests that neurons may regulate their conductances to maintain fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal conductances, and that the regulation process requires feedback systems capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a number of different time scales.},

A nucleated patch was pulled and a voltage-clamp step was applied. The exponential decay of the capacitative charging current was analyzed to give the total membrane capacitance, which was then divided by the observed surface area of the patch. Cm was 0.9$\mu$F/cm2 for each class of neuron. To test the possibility that membrane proteins may alter Cm, embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were studied before and after transfection with a plasmid coding for glycine receptor/channels. The value of Cm was indistinguishable in untransfected cells and in transfected cells expressing a high level of glycine channels, indicating that differences in transmembrane protein content do not significantly affect Cm. Thus, to a first approximation, Cm may be treated as a ``biological constant'' across many classes of neuron.},

  abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

Anatomical studies of single pyloric network neurons and of the whole stomatogastric ganglion (STG) showed that the STG and its neurons grow considerably from juvenile to adult. Despite these changes in size, intracellularly recorded membrane potential waveforms of pyloric network neurons and the phase relationships in the pyloric rhythm were very similar between juvenile and adult preparations. Across adult preparations, the cycle period and number of spikes per burst were not tightly maintained, but the mean phase relationships were independent of the period of the rhythm and relatively tightly maintained across preparations.

Measurements of channel expression in the two electrically coupled pyloric dilator (PD) neurons showed significant interanimal variability, but copy numbers for IH (encoding the hyperpolarization-activated, inward-current channel) and Shal mRNA in the two PD neurons from the same crab were similar, suggesting that the regulation of some currents may be shared in electrically coupled neurons.},

  abstract = {Dynamic-clamp is a fascinating electrophysiology technique that consists of merging living neurons with computational models. The dynamic-clamp (also called "conductance injection") allows experimentalists and theoreticians to challenge neurons (or any other type of cell) with complex conductance stimuli generated by a computer.  The technique can be implemented from neural simulation environments and a variety of custom-made or commercial systems. The real-time interaction between the computer and cell also enables the design of recording paradigms with unprecedented accuracy via a computational model of the electrode. Dynamic-Clamp: From Principles to Applications contains contributions from leading researchers in the field, who investigate these paradigms at the cellular or network level, in vivo and in vitro, and in different brain regions and cardiac cells. Topics discussed include the addition of artificially-generated synaptic activity to neurons; adding, amplifying or neutralizing voltage-dependent conductances; creating hybrid networks with real and artificial cells; attaching simulated dendritic tree structures to the living cell; and connecting different neurons.   This book will be of interest to experimental biophysicists, neurophysiologists, and cardiac physiologists, as well as theoreticians, engineers, and computational neuroscientists. Graduate and undergraduate students will also find up-to-date coverage of physiological problems and how they are investigated.

While the forces that synchronize the flashing of fireflies may seem to have nothing to do with our heart cells, there is in fact a deep connection. Synchrony is a science in its infancy, and Strogatz is a pioneer in this new frontier in which mathematicians and physicists attempt to pinpoint just how spontaneous order emerges from chaos. From underground caves in Texas where a French scientist spent six months alone tracking his sleep-wake cycle, to the home of a Dutch physicist who in 1665 discovered two of his pendulum clocks swinging in perfect time, this fascinating book spans disciplines, continents, and centuries.

Regulated model neurons maintain a constant average level of activity over a wide range of conditions by appropriately adjusting their conductances. The intracellular calcium concentration acts as a feedback element linking maximal conductances to electrical activity. The resulting plasticity of intrinsic characteristics has important implications for network behavior. We first study a simple two-conductance model, then introduce techniques that allow us to analyze dynamic regulation with an arbitrary number of conductances, and finally illustrate this method by studying a seven-conductance model.

  abstract = {Conventionally, the parameters of neuronal models are hand-tuned using trial-and-error searches to produce a desired behavior. Here, we present an alternative approach. We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency-current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},

  abstract = {For decades, the episodic gastric rhythm of the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) has served as an important model system for understanding the generation of rhythmic motor behaviors. Here we quantitatively describe many features of the gastric rhythm of the crab Cancer borealis under several conditions. First, we analyzed spontaneous gastric rhythms produced by freshly dissected preparations of the STNS, including the cycle frequency and phase relationships among gastric units. We find that phase is relatively conserved across frequency, similar to the pyloric rhythm. We also describe relationships between these two rhythms, including a significant gastric/pyloric frequency correlation. We then performed continuous, days-long extracellular recordings of gastric activity from preparations of the STNS in which neuromodulatory inputs to the stomatogastric ganglion were left intact and also from preparations in which these modulatory inputs were cut (decentralization). This allowed us to provide quantitative descriptions of variability and phase conservation within preparations across time. For intact preparations, gastric activity was more variable than pyloric activity but remained relatively stable across 4\textendash{}6 days, and many significant correlations were found between phase and frequency within animals. Decentralized preparations displayed fewer episodes of gastric activity, with altered phase relationships, lower frequencies, and reduced coordination both among gastric units and between the gastric and pyloric rhythms. Together, these results provide insight into the role of neuromodulation in episodic pattern generation and the extent of animal-to-animal variability in features of spontaneously occurring gastric rhythms.},

Previous work, done in the presence of descending modulatory inputs, had shown that the pyloric rhythm of the crab increases in frequency as temperature increases, but maintains its characteristic phase relationships until it 'crashes' at extreme high temperatures. To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, while serotonin made the rhythm less robust. These experiments reveal considerable animal-to-animal diversity in their crash stability, consistent with the interpretation that cryptic differences in many cell and network parameters are revealed by extreme perturbations.},

  abstract = {The modulation of the pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the lobster Panulirus interruptus by the neuropeptide proctolin is described. First, the effects of proctolin on the pyloric motor patterns were characterized in terms of frequency and phase relations. Pyloric cycle frequency and lateral pyloric (LP) neuron activity increased and ventricular dilator (VD) neuron activity decreased with increasing concentrations (10(-9)-10(-6) M) of applied proctolin. Next, the effects of proctolin on the individual neurons that constitute the pyloric network were determined. Identified neurons were isolated from chemical and electrical presynaptic inputs by using pharmacological agents (Marder and Eisen, 1984a) and/or photoinactivation following Lucifer yellow injection (Miller and Selverston, 1979). Proctolin increased the amplitude and frequency of bursts produced by isolated pacemaker anterior burster (AB) neurons. Isolated LP and pyloric (PY) neurons responded to proctolin with increases in activity only when they were at or above threshold. All other pyloric neurons were unaffected. To determine how the direct effects of proctolin on isolated neurons resulted in the observed changes in frequency and phase relations in the motor pattern of the intact pyloric circuit seen in proctolin, individual neurons were deleted from the circuit. A comparison of proctolin's effects on isolated neurons with those on the intact network shows that the synaptic connectivity among neurons directly affected by proctolin and those unaffected by it shapes the network's response to proctolin.},

  abstract = {1. Results from the companion paper were incorporated into a physiologically realistic computer model of the three principal cell types (PD/AB, LP, PY) of the pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion. Parameters for the model were mostly calculated (sometimes estimated) from experimental data rather than fitting the model to observed output patterns. 2. The initial run was successful in predicting several features of the pyloric pattern: the observed gap between PD and LP bursts, the appropriate sequence of the activity periods (PD, LP, PY), and a substantial PY burst not properly simulated by an earlier model. 3. The major discrepancy between model and observed patterns was the too-early occurrence of the PY burst, which resulted in a much shortened LP burst. Motivated by this discrepancy, additional investigations were made of PY properties. A hyperpolarization-enabled depolorization-activated hyperpolarizing conductance change was discovered which may make an important contribution to the late phase of PY activity in the normal burst cycle. Addition of this effect to the model brought its predictions more in line with observed patterns. 4. Other discrepancies between model and observation were instructive and are discussed. The findings force a substantial revision in previously held ideas on pattern production in the pyloric system. More weight must be given to functional properties of individual neurons and less to properties arising purely from network interactions. This shift in emphasis may be necessary in more complicated systems as well. 5. An example has been provided of the value quantitative modeling can be to network physiology. Only through rigorous quantitative testing can qualitative theories of how the nervous system operates be substantiated.},

  abstract = {The extent to which individual neural networks can producephase-constant motor patterns as cycle frequency is altered has notbeen studied extensively. I investigated this issue in thewell-defined, rhythmic pyloric neural network. When pyloric cyclefrequency is altered three- to fivefold, pyloric inter-neuronaldelays shift by hundreds to thousands of msec, and all pyloricpattern elements show strong phase maintenance. The experimentalparadigm used is unlikely to activate exogenous inputs to thenetwork, and these delay changes are thus likely to arise fromphase-compensatory mechanisms intrinsic to the network. Pyloricinter-neuronal delays depend on the time constants of the network`ssynapses and of the membrane properties of its neurons. The observeddelay shifts thus suggest that, in response to changes in overallcycle frequency, these constants vary so as to maintain patternphasing.},

This change is not only due to the emergence of new powerful tools for the analysis of the brain and its reactions to insults, but it also reflects a conceptual change in the way we approach these problems. As an illustration to this development, it is instructive to go back to the proceedings of a meeting at the NIH in 1955 edited by William F. Windle, which summarizes the disillusioned and pessimistic view on CNS regeneration prevailing at the time. While this generation of researchers were well aware of the issues at stake, they felt they had reached the end of the road; the approaches they had pursued had got stuck and the tools available could not take them any further. I can very well imagine that the participants, most of them leaders in the field, left that conference feeling they had heard their field being sentenced to death.},

Each pattern corresponds to a specific behavioural situation: pattern 1 is only observed in unfed lobsters and feeding invariably produces a switch from pattern 1 to pattern 2 (Fig. 3). 3.The two pyloric patterns differ in the period of the cycle (Fig. 4), the burst duration of the constrictors (Fig. 5), the latency of firing of the constrictors in the cycle (Fig. 6) and the phase of the constrictors in the cycle (Fig. 7). Correlation between period and constrictor latency is weak in pattern 1 and strong in pattern 2 (Fig. 8). 4.The two pyloric patterns can be recorded from in vitro preparations only when the stomatogastric ganglion (i.e. the CPG) is connected to the more rostral commissural ganglia (Fig. 9). 5.At least in pattern 1, cycling of the constrictors can occur when the dilators (known as pacemakers in the CPG) are silent (Fig. 10). 6.For these reasons, we concluded that a commissural oscillator could be participating in the organization of the pyloric output. However, the synaptic relationships which exist between the motor neurones (i.e. the CPG) cannot be neglected (Fig. 11) and this suggests that, in the intact animal, the motor output is organized by the cooperation of a premotor oscillator and a motor oscillator.},

  issn = {0022-3077},
  abstract = {Rhythmic movements of the gastric mill and pyloric regions of the crustacean foregut are controlled by two stomatogastric neuronal networks that have been intensively studied in vitro. By using electromyographic recordings from the European lobster, Homarus gammarus, we have monitored simultaneously the motor activity of pyloric and gastric mill muscles for $<$/=3 mo in intact and freely behaving animals. Both pyloric and gastric mill networks are almost continuously active in vivo regardless of the presence of food. In unfed resting animals kept under "natural-like" conditions, the pyloric network expresses the typical triphasic pattern seen in vitro but at considerably slower cycle periods (2. 5-3.5 s instead of 1-1.5 s). Gastric mill activity occurs at mean cycle periods of 20-50 s compared with 5-10 s in vitro but may suddenly stop for up to tens of minutes, then restart without any apparent behavioral reason. When conjointly active, the two networks express a strict coupling that involves certain but not all motor neurons of the pyloric network. The posterior pyloric constrictor muscles, innervated by a total of 8 pyloric (PY) motor neurons, are influenced by the onset of each gastric mill medial gastric/lateral gastric(MG/LG) neuron powerstroke burst, and for one cycle, PY neuron bursts may attain $>$300\% of their mean duration. However, the duration of activity in the lateral pyloric constrictor muscle, innervated by the unique lateral pyloric (LP) motor neuron, remains unaffected by this perturbation. During this period after gastric perturbation, LP neuron and PY neurons thus express opposite burst-to-period relationships in that LP neuron burst duration is independent of the ongoing cycle period, whereas PY neuron burst duration changes with period length. In vitro the same type of gastro-pyloric interaction is observed, indicating that it is not dependent on sensory inputs. Moreover, this interaction is intrinsic to the stomatogastric ganglion itself because the relationship between the two networks persists after suppression of descending inputs to the ganglion. Intracellular recordings reveal that this gastro-pyloric interaction originates from the gastric MG and LG neurons of the gastric network, which inhibit the pyloric pacemaker ensemble. As a consequence, the pyloric PY neurons, which are inhibited by the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons of the pyloric pacemaker group, extend their activity during the time that PD neuron is held silent. Moreover, there is evidence for a pyloro-gastric interaction, apparently rectifying, from the pyloric pacemakers back to the gastric MG/LG neuron group.},

Subsets of these projection neurons can contain the same neuromodulator(s), yet little is known about the relative influence of such neurons on network activity. We have addressed this issue in the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis. Within this system, there is a neuronal network in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) that produces many versions of the pyloric and gastric mill rhythms. These different rhythms result from activation of different projection neurons that innervate the STG from neighboring ganglia and modulate STG network activity. Three pairs of these projection neurons contain the neuropeptide proctolin. These include the previously identified modulatory proctolin neuron and modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) and the newly identified modulatory commissural neuron 7 (MCN7). We document here that each of these neurons contains a unique complement of cotransmitters and that each of these neurons elicits a distinct version of the pyloric motor pattern. Moreover, only one of them (MCN1) also elicits a gastric mill rhythm. The MCN7-elicited pyloric rhythm includes a pivotal switch by one STG network neuron from playing a minor to a major role in motor pattern generation. Therefore, modulatory neurons that share a peptide transmitter can elicit distinct motor patterns from a common target network.},

  abstract = {The amines dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and octopamine (Oct) each elicit a distinctive motor pattern from a quiescent pyloric network in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG). We previously have demonstrated that these amines alter the synaptic strength at multiple, distributed sites within the pyloric network that could contribute to the amine-induced motor patterns. Here, we examined the postsynaptic contribution to these changes in synaptic strength by determining how the amines modify responses of pyloric motor neurons to glutamate (Glu), one of the network transmitters, applied iontophoretically into the STG neuropil. Dopamine reduced the Glu responses of the pyloric dilator (PD), ventricular dilator (VD), and inferior cardiac (IC) neurons and enhanced the Glu responses of the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric constrictor (PY) neurons. The only effect of 5-HT was to reduce the Glu response of the VD neuron. Oct enhanced the Glu responses of the LP and PY neurons but did not affect the PD, VD, and IC responses. We also examined amine effects on the depolarizing responses to iontophoresed acetylcholine (ACh) in the PD and VD and found that they paralleled the amine effects on Glu responses in these neurons. This suggests that amine modulation of PD and VD responses to Glu and ACh may be explained by general changes in the ionic conductance of these neurons. We compare our results with our earlier work describing amine effects on synaptic strength and input resistance to show that amines act at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to modify graded synaptic transmission in the pyloric network.},

  abstract = {The crustacean pyloric Central Pattern Generator (CPG) is a nervous circuit that endogenously provides periodic motor patterns. Even after about 40 years of intensive studies, the rhythm genesis is still not rigorously understood in this CPG, mainly because it is made of neurons with irregular intrinsic activity. Using mathematical models we addressed the question of using a network of irregularly behaving elements to generate periodic oscillations, and we show some advantages of using non-periodic neurons with intrinsic behavior in the transition from bursting to tonic spiking (as found in biological pyloric CPGs) as building components. We studied two- and three-neuron model CPGs built either with Hindmarsh-Rose or with conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley-like model neurons. By changing a model's parameter we could span the neuron's intrinsic dynamical behavior from slow periodic bursting to fast tonic spiking, passing through a transition where irregular bursting was observed. Two-neuron CPG, half center oscillator (HCO), was obtained for each intrinsic behavior of the neurons by coupling them with mutual symmetric synaptic inhibition. Most of these HCOs presented regular antiphasic bursting activity and the changes of the bursting frequencies was studied as a function of the inhibitory synaptic strength. Among all HCOs, those made of intrinsic irregular neurons presented a wider burst frequency range while keeping a reliable regular oscillatory (bursting) behavior. HCOs of periodic neurons tended to be either hard to change their behavior with synaptic strength variations (slow periodic burster neurons) or unable to perform a physiologically meaningful rhythm (fast tonic spiking neurons). Moreover, 3-neuron CPGs with connectivity and output similar to those of the pyloric CPG presented the same results.},

Specifically, we investigated decentralization-induced changes in the distribution and density of the transient outward current,I A, which is encoded within the STG by the shal gene and plays an important role in shaping rhythmic bursting of pyloric neurons. Using an antibody against lobster shal K+ channels, we found shal immunoreactivity in the membranes of neuritic processes, but not somata, of STG neurons in 5 d cultured STNS with intact modulatory inputs. However, in 5 d decentralized STG, shal immunoreactivity was still seen in primary neurites but was likewise present in a subset of STG somata. Among the neurons displaying this altered shal localization was the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron, which remained rhythmically active in 5 d decentralized STG. Two-electrode voltage clamp was used to compare I A in synaptically isolated PD neurons in long-term decentralized STG and nondecentralized controls. Although the voltage dependence and kinetics ofI A changed little with decentralization, the maximal conductance of I A in PD neurons increased by 43.4\%. This increase was consistent with the decentralization-induced increase in shal protein expression, indicating an alteration in the density and distribution of functional A-channels. Our results suggest that, in addition to the short-term regulation of network function, modulatory inputs may also play a role, either directly or indirectly, in controlling channel number and distribution, thereby maintaining the biophysical character of neuronal targets on a long-term basis.},

The solutions resembled the morphology of real neurons. In particular the neurons optimized for linear summation electrotonically separated their synapses, as found in avian nucleus laminaris neurons, and neurons optimized for spike-order detection had primary dendrites of significantly different diameter, as found in the basal and apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons.

  abstract = {Understanding the principles governing axonal and dendritic branching is essential for unravelling the functionality of single neurons and the way in which they connect. Nevertheless, no formalism has yet been described which can capture the general features of neuronal branching. Here we propose such a formalism, which is derived from the expression of dendritic arborizations as locally optimized graphs. Inspired by Ram{\'o}n y Cajal's laws of conservation of cytoplasm and conduction time in neural circuitry, we show that this graphical representation can be used to optimize these variables. This approach allows us to generate synthetic branching geometries which replicate morphological features of any tested neuron. The essential structure of a neuronal tree is thereby captured by the density profile of its spanning field and by a single parameter, a balancing factor weighing the costs for material and conduction time. This balancing factor determines a neuron's electrotonic compartmentalization. Additions to this rule, when required in the construction process, can be directly attributed to developmental processes or a neuron's computational role within its neural circuit. The simulations presented here are implemented in an open-source software package, the "TREES toolbox," which provides a general set of tools for analyzing, manipulating, and generating dendritic structure, including a tool to create synthetic members of any particular cell group and an approach for a model-based supervised automatic morphological reconstruction from fluorescent image stacks. These approaches provide new insights into the constraints governing dendritic architectures. They also provide a novel framework for modelling and analyzing neuronal branching structures and for constructing realistic synthetic neural networks.},

We show here, using compartmental models of reconstructed cortical neurons, that an entire spectrum of firing patterns can be reproduced in a set of neurons that share a common distribution of ion channels and differ only in their dendritic geometry. The essential behaviour of the model depends on partial electrical coupling of fast active conductances localized to the soma and axon and slow active currents located throughout the dendrites, and can be reproduced in a two-compartment model. The results suggest a causal relationship for the observed correlations between dendritic structure and firing properties and emphasize the importance of active dendritic conductances in neuronal function.},

To determine whether the changes in the currents are sufficient to produce the change in action potential duration and ionic dependence, we constructed a Hodgkin-Huxley model of electrical excitability of these neurons. The model shows that the equations describing the voltage- clamped currents of young and mature neurons generate action potentials appropriate in duration and ionic dependence for each developmental stage. Moreover, the observed changes in the currents are quantitatively sufficient to produce the changes in the action potential. The effect of the change in each current is detectable in the model. However, the increase in amplitude of the delayed-rectifier potassium current has the largest effect. The model further shows that changes in action potential duration could be achieved with changes in kinetics rather than amplitude of this current, or with changes in amplitudes of other currents. Thus, although increase in amplitude of the delayed rectifier plays a pivotal role in the maturation of excitability, it is not uniquely positioned to govern the action potential duration.},

We introduce a channel-based model for this neuron and show how bifurcation analysis can be used to investigate the response of this model to changes of its parameters. Two dimensional maps of the parameter space of the model were constructed using computational tools based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. Changes in the intrinsic firing and oscillatory properties of the model AB neuron were correlated with the boundaries of Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations on these maps. Complex rhythmic patterns were observed, with a bounded region of the parameter plane producing bursting behavior of the model neuron. Experiments were performed by treating an isolated AB cell with 4-aminopyridine which selectively reduces gA, the conductance of the transient potassium channel. The model accurately predicts the qualitative changes in the neuronal voltage oscillations that are observed over a range of reduction of gA in the neuron. These results demonstrate the efficacy of dynamical systems theory as a means of determining the varied oscillatory behaviors inherent in a channel-based neural model. Further, the maps of bifurcations provide a useful tool for determining how these behaviors depend upon model parameters and comparing the model to a real neuron.},

  abstract = {I have used neurophysiological techniques to study the biophysical properties of the Lateral Pyloric cell of the Stomatogastric Ganglion in the rock crab Cancer borealis. Using this cell as a model cell of the pyloric system, the goal was to study the dependence of the excitability of this cell on the different ionic currents it expresses. Thus the strategy I have used is to identify as many ionic currents as could be detected, describe their properties, and use them to generate a computer program that would incorporate all of them into a model cell that reproduces the basic features of the activity of the real cell. This technique can then be used to study in detail the excitability properties of the cell and the contribution each current makes to its general activity.
I identified seven time and/or voltage dependent conductances: a delayed rectifier current, a Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-activated outward current, an A-like current, a Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$ current, an inwardly rectifying current, a TTX-sensitive inward current, and a new voltage dependent current activated by the pentapeptide proctolin. Additionally, I observed three voltage independent currents: a leak current, a component of which may be Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-dependent and two GABA activated currents, one that partially resembles the known GABA\$$\backslash$sb\{$\backslash$rm B\}\$ activated current and another GABA activated cationic current. The proctolin activated current shows a voltage dependence that allows it to strongly influence the excitability of the cell in spite of its small amplitude.
The computer generated model cell shows the surprising result that the action potential termination in this cell is mostly due to the activation of the Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-activated current and not the delayed rectifier. It shows also how the relative contribution of each ionic current to the activity of the cell is modified when the peptide proctolin activates a separate, independent current. In the future this model could be used as the basis to explore the contribution of neuronal geometry to cellular activity.
I describe a cell culture protocol for Stomatogastric neurons and some preliminary electrophysiological data on these cells.},

  abstract = {The neurotransmitters mediating the synaptic interactions among the neurons of the pyloric system of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the lobster, Panulirus interruptus, were examined using a combination of electrophysiological, pharmacological, and biochemical techniques. Iontophoretically applied L-glutamate inhibited all motor neurons of the pyloric system. This inhibitory response was blocked by low concentrations of picrotoxin but unaffected by atropine. The anterior burster (AB) interneuron, pyloric dilator (PD) motor neurons, and ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron were depolarized and excited by iontophoretically applied acetylcholine (ACh). The lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) constrictor motor neurons were inhibited by ACh and by the cholinergic agonist, carbachol. These inhibitory cholinergic responses were blocked by atropine but not by picrotoxin. The inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) evoked by the constrictor motor neurons were blocked by picrotoxin but not by atropine. Taken together with previously published data (15, 18), this suggests that the constrictor motor neurons release glutamate at both their excitatory neuromuscular junctions and their inhibitory intraganglionic junctions. The lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique (27) was used to study separately the neurotransmitters released by the electrically coupled PD and AB neurons. The AB-evoked IPSPs were blocked by picrotoxin but not by atropine. The PD-evoked IPSPs were blocked by atropine and other muscarinic antagonists but not by picrotoxin. Somata of PD neurons contained choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity, but somata of AB neurons contained no detectable CAT activity. On the basis of the data in this paper and previously published data (17, 18), we conclude that the PD neurons release ACh at both their excitatory neuromuscular junctions and their inhibitory intraganglionic connections. Although the AB neuron is electrically coupled to the PD neurons, the AB neuron is not cholinergic. Glutamate is a likely transmitter candidate for the AB neuron. These data show that electrically coupled neurons can release different transmitters. Furthermore, these data show that an IPSP can be the result of the combined actions of two different neurotransmitters, each released from a different neuron. The functional consequences of these conclusions are explored in the following papers (9, 22).},

  abstract = {1. The pyloric dilator (PD) and anterior burster (AB) neurons in the pyloric system of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion are electrically coupled and synchronously active. We have used the lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique to separate the connections made by the PD motor neurons from those made by the AB interneuron. 2. Photoinactivation of either the two PD neurons or the single AB neuron allowed us to separate the compound inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) motor neurons resulting from synchronous PD and AB activity into AB-evoked and PD-evoked components. These IPSPs have different time courses, reversal potentials, ion selectivities, and pharmacological properties. 3. Photoinactivation and membrane-potential manipulations indicated that a readily observable IPSP recorded in the AB neuron and correlated with action potentials in the LP neuron is actually an electrotonic potential due to an LP-evoked IPSP in the PD neurons. 4. Selective inactivation of either the two PD neurons or the AB neuron revealed that the IPSP recorded in the ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron is due solely to AB-released transmitter. 5. The electrical coupling potentials measurable between the AB, PD, and VD neuron somata are due to direct electrical coupling between all of these neurons. 6. Circuit analysis and transmitter identification may be complicated by electrical coupling. We suggest that the presence of electrical coupling between nonidentical neurons may provide a new mechanism that allows changes in synaptic characteristics among neurons within a "hard-wired" circuit.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00422-012-0514-6},
  abstract = {The notion that biological systems come to embody optimal solutions seems consistent with the competitive drive of evolution. It has been used to interpret many examples of sensorimotor behavior. It is attractive from the viewpoint of control engineers because it solves the redundancy problem by identifying the one optimal motor strategy out of many similarly acceptable possibilities. This perspective examines whether there is sufficient basis to apply the formal engineering tools of optimal control to a reductionist understanding of biological systems. For an experimental biologist, this translates into whether the theory of optimal control generates nontrivial and testable hypotheses that accurately predict novel phenomena, ideally at deeper levels of structure than the observable behavior. The methodology of optimal control is applicable when there is (i) a single, known cost function to be optimized, (ii) an invertible model of the plant, and (iii) simple noise interfering with optimal performance. None of these is likely to be true for biological organisms. Furthermore, their motivation is usually good-enough rather than globally optimal behavior. Even then, the performance of a biological organism is often much farther from optimal than the physical limits of its hardware because the brain is continuously testing the acceptable limits of performance as well as just performing the task. This perspective considers an alternative strategy called "good-enough" control, in which the organism uses trial-and-error learning to acquire a repertoire of sensorimotor behaviors that are known to be useful, but not necessarily optimal. This leads to a diversity of solutions that tends to confer robustness on the individual organism and its evolution. It is also more consistent with the capabilities of higher sensorimotor structures, such as cerebral cortex, which seems to be designed to classify and recall complex sets of information, thereby allowing the organism to learn from experience, rather than to compute new strategies online. Optimal control has been a useful metaphor for understanding some superficial aspects of motor psychophysics. Reductionists who want to understand the underlying neural mechanisms need to move on.},

Expression of a nonfunctional mutant Shal also induces a large increase in Ih, demonstrating a novel activity-independent coupling between the Shal protein and Ih enhancement.

  abstract = {Information from the senses must be compressed into the limited range of responses that spiking neurons can generate. For optimal compression, the neuron's response should match the statistics of stimuli encountered in nature. Given a maximum firing rate, a nerve cell should learn to use each available firing rate equally often. Given a set mean firing rate, it should self-organize to respond with high firing rates only to comparatively rare events. Here we derive an unsupervised learning rule that continuously adapts membrane conductances of a Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron to optimize the representation of sensory information in the firing rate. Maximizing information transfer between the stimulus and the cell's firing rate can be interpreted as a non-Hebbian developmental mechanism.},

Depriving pyramidal neurons of activity for two days increased sensitivity to current injection by selectively regulating voltage-dependent conductances. This suggests that one mechanism by which neurons maintain sensitivity to different levels of synaptic input is by altering the function relating current to firing rate.},

I then discuss a number of issues raised by this observation, such as which parameter variations arise from compensatory mechanisms and which reflect insensitivity to those particular parameters. I ask whether networks with different sets of underlying parameters can nonetheless respond reliably to neuromodulation and other global perturbations. At the computational level, I describe a paradigm shift in which it is becoming increasingly common to develop families of models that reflect the variance in the biological data that the models are intended to illuminate rather than single, highly tuned models. On the experimental side, I discuss the inherent limitations of overreliance on mean data and suggest that it is important to look for compensations and correlations among as many system parameters as possible, and between each system parameter and circuit performance. This second paradigm shift will require moving away from measurements of each system component in isolation but should reveal important previously undescribed principles in the organization of complex systems such as brains.},

To explore the validity of this procedure, we studied the behavior of a conductance-based model neuron with five voltage-dependent conductances. We randomly varied the maximal conductance of each of the active currents in the model and identified sets of maximal conductances that generate bursting neurons that fire a single action potential at the peak of a slow membrane potential depolarization. A model constructed using the means of the maximal conductances of this population is not itself a one-spike burster, but rather fires three action potentials per burst. Averaging fails because the maximal conductances of the population of one-spike bursters lie in a highly concave region of parameter space that does not contain its mean. This demonstrates that averages over multiple samples can fail to characterize a system whose behavior depends on interactions involving a number of highly variable components.},

  volume = {70},
  issn = {0022-3077},
  abstract = {1. We explore the roles of conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models using a method that allows the explicit linking of HH model input-output behavior to parameter values for maximal conductances, voltage shifts, and time constants. The procedure can be used to identify not only the parameter values most critical to supporting a neuronal activity pattern of interest but also the relationships between parameters which may be required, e.g., limited ranges of relative magnitudes. 2. The method is the repeated use of stochastic search to find hundreds or even thousands of different sets of model parameter values that allow a HH model to produce a desired behavior, such as current-frequency transduction, to within a desired tolerance, e.g., frequency match to within 10 Hz. Graphical or other analysis may then be performed to reveal the shape and boundaries of the parameter solution regions that support the desired behavior. 3. The shape of these parameter regions can reveal parameter values and relationships essential to the behavior. For instance, graphical display may reveal covariances between maximal conductance values, or a much wider range of variation in some maximal conductance values than in others. 4. We demonstrate the use of these techniques with simple, representative HH models, primarily that of Connor et al. for crustacean walking leg axons, but also some extensions of the results are explored using the more complex model of McCormick and Huguenard for thalamocortical relay neurons. Both models are single compartment. Behaviors studied include current-to-frequency transduction, the time delay to first action potential in response to current steps, and the timing of action potential occurrences in response to both square-wave current injection and the injection of currents derived from in vitro records of excitatory postsynaptic currents. 5. Using these simple models, we find that relatively general behaviors such as current-frequency (I/F) curves may be supported by very broad, but bounded parameter solution regions, with the shape of the solution regions revealing the relative importance of the maximal conductances of a model in creating the behavior. Furthermore, we find that a focus on increasingly specific behaviors, such as I/F behavior, defined by tolerances of only a few hertz combined with strict requirements for action potential height, inevitably leads to increasingly narrow, and eventually nonphysiologically narrow, regions of acceptable parameter values. 6. We use the Connor et al. model to reproduce the in vitro action potential timing responses of a rat brain stem neuron to various stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Electrical coupling between neurons with similar properties is often studied. Nonetheless, the role of electrical coupling between neurons with widely different intrinsic properties also occurs, but is less well understood. Inspired by the pacemaker group of the crustacean pyloric network, we developed a multicompartment, conductance-based model of a small network of intrinsically distinct, electrically coupled neurons. In the pyloric network, a small intrinsically bursting neuron, through gap junctions, drives 2 larger, tonically spiking neurons to reliably burst in-phase with it. Each model neuron has 2 compartments, one responsible for spike generation and the other for producing a slow, large-amplitude oscillation. We illustrate how these compartments interact and determine the dynamics of the model neurons. Our model captures the dynamic oscillation range measured from the isolated and coupled biological neurons. At the network level, we explore the range of coupling strengths for which synchronous bursting oscillations are possible. The spatial segregation of ionic currents significantly enhances the ability of the 2 neurons to burst synchronously, and the oscillation range of the model pacemaker network depends not only on the strength of the electrical synapse but also on the identity of the neuron receiving inputs. We also compare the activity of the electrically coupled, distinct neurons with that of a network of coupled identical bursting neurons. For small to moderate coupling strengths, the network of identical elements, when receiving asymmetrical inputs, can have a smaller dynamic range of oscillation than that of its constituent neurons in isolation.},

The paucity of homologous character data across disparately related lineages currently renders direct phylogenetic inference untenable.

We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips\textemdash{}the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. Although data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics.},

Principal temperature sensors belong to the TRP cation channel family, but the mechanisms underlying the marked temperature sensitivity of opening and closing (`gating') of these channels are unknown. Here we show that temperature sensing is tightly linked to voltage-dependent gating in the cold-sensitive channel TRPM8 and the heat-sensitive channel TRPV1. Both channels are activated upon depolarization, and changes in temperature result in graded shifts of their voltage-dependent activation curves. The chemical agonists menthol (TRPM8) and capsaicin (TRPV1) function as gating modifiers, shifting activation curves towards physiological membrane potentials. Kinetic analysis of gating at different temperatures indicates that temperature sensitivity in TRPM8 and TRPV1 arises from a tenfold difference in the activation energies associated with voltage-dependent opening and closing. Our results suggest a simple unifying principle that explains both cold and heat sensitivity in TRP channels.},

  abstract = {The crab Cancer borealis undergoes large daily fluctuations in environmental temperature (8\textendash{}24$^\circ$C) and must maintain appropriate neural function in the face of this perturbation. In the pyloric circuit of the crab stomatogastric ganglion, we pharmacologically isolated the pacemaker kernel (the AB and PD neurons) and characterized its behavior in response to temperature ramps from 7$^\circ$C to 31$^\circ$C. For moderate temperatures, the pacemaker displayed a frequency-temperature curve statistically indistinguishable from that of the intact circuit, and like the intact circuit maintained a constant duty cycle. At high temperatures (above 23$^\circ$C), a variety of different behaviors were seen: in some preparations the pacemaker increased in frequency, in some it slowed, and in many preparations the pacemaker stopped oscillating (``crashed''). Furthermore, these crashes seemed to fall into two qualitatively different classes. Additionally, the animal-to-animal variability in frequency increased at high temperatures. We used a series of Morris-Lecar mathematical models to gain insight into these phenomena. The biophysical components of the final model have temperature sensitivities similar to those found in nature, and can crash via two qualitatively different mechanisms that resemble those observed experimentally. The crash type is determined by the precise parameters of the model at the reference temperature, 11$^\circ$C, which could explain why some preparations seem to crash in one way and some in another. Furthermore, even models with very similar behavior at the reference temperature diverge greatly at high temperatures, resembling the experimental observations., The nervous systems of cold-blooded animals must maintain essential function despite fluctuations in environmental temperature. We studied the pyloric rhythm of the crab, Cancer borealis. The pyloric rhythm is important for the animal's feeding behavior, and previous work has shown that relative timing, or phase, of the neurons in the pyloric circuit is temperature invariant over a range of physiologically realistic temperatures (7 to 23$^\circ$C), although the frequency of the rhythm increases. At higher temperatures, the rhythm often becomes disorganized or stops. In this paper we present experimental work on the isolated pacemaker of the pyloric rhythm together with a computational model that explores the loss of stability of the pacemaker as a function of temperature. Experimentally, we found that the isolated pacemaker responds to temperature similarly to the intact network, and maintains constant duty cycle over large temperature ranges. At high temperatures, about half of the pacemakers stop oscillating, reminiscent of certain mathematical bifurcations. We varied the temperature dependence and conductance densities of a simple model oscillator, and characterized its bifurcations as a function of temperature. We found that particular temperature-dependent relationships must be maintained to provide robust temperature performance of oscillators with variable underlying conductances.},

Nonetheless, at more extreme high temperatures, the normal triphasic pyloric rhythm breaks down, or ``crashes''. We present both experimental and computational approaches to understanding the stability of both single neurons and networks to temperature perturbations, and discuss data that shows that the ``crash'' temperatures themselves may be environmentally regulated.

The results are presented in the context of half-center oscillators, which are simple rhythmic circuits composed of two reciprocally connected inhibitory neuronal populations. Specifically, we focus on rhythms that rely on a particular excitability property, the post-inhibitory rebound, an intrinsic cellular property that elicits transient membrane depolarization when released from hyperpolarization. Two distinct ionic currents can evoke this transient depolarization: a hyperpolarization-activated cation current and a low-threshold T-type calcium current. The presence of a slow activation is specific to the T-type calcium current and provides a slow positive feedback at the cellular level that is absent in the cation current. We show that this slow positive feedback is required to endow the network rhythm with physiological modulation and robustness properties. This study thereby identifies an essential cellular property to be retained at the network level in modeling network robustness and modulation.},

These coordinating interneurons, along with the oscillator interneurons, form an eight-cell timing oscillator network for heartbeat. Still other interneurons, along with the oscillator interneurons, inhibit heart motor neurons, sculpting their activity into rhythmic bursts. Critical switch interneurons interface between the oscillator interneurons and the other premotor interneurons to produce two alternating coordination states of the motor neurons. The periods of the oscillator interneurons are modulated by endogenous RFamide neuropeptides. We have explored the ionic currents and graded and spike-mediated synaptic transmission that promote oscillation in the oscillator interneurons and have incorporated these data into a conductance-based computer model. This model has been of considerable predictive value and has led to new insights into how reciprocally inhibitory neurons produce oscillation. We are now in a strong position to expand this model upward, to encompass the entire heartbeat network, horizontally, to elucidate the mechanisms of FMRFamide modulation, and downward, to incorporate cellular morphology. By studying the mechanisms of motor pattern formation in the leech, using modeling studies in conjunction with parallel physiological experiments, we can contribute to a deeper understanding of how rhythmic motor acts are generated, coordinated, modulated, and reconfigured at the level of networks, cells, ionic currents, and synapses. \textcopyright{} 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The leech heartbeat central pattern generator is paced by a core timing network, which consists of two coupled segmental oscillators in segmental ganglia 3 and 4. The segmental oscillators comprise paired mutually inhibitory oscillator interneurons and the processes of intersegmental coordinating interneurons. As a first step in understanding the coordination of segmental motor outflow by this pattern generator, we describe the functional synaptic interactions, and activity and phase relationships of the heart interneurons of the timing network, in isolated nerve cord preparations. In the timing network, most ($\sim$75\%) of the coordinating interneuron action potentials were generated at a primary spike initiation site located in ganglion 4 (G4). A secondary spike initiation site in ganglion 3 (G3) became active in the absence of activity at the primary site. Generally, the secondary site was characterized by a reluctance to burst and a lower spike frequency, when compared with the primary site. Oscillator interneurons in G3 inhibited spike activity at both initiation sites, whereas oscillator interneurons in G4 inhibited spike activity only at the primary initiation site. This asymmetry in the control of spike activity in the coordinating interneurons may account for the observation that the phase of the coordinating interneurons is more tightly linked to the G3 than G4 oscillator interneurons. The cycle period of the timing network and the phase difference between the ipsilateral G3 and G4 oscillator interneurons were regular within individual preparations, but varied among preparations. This variation in phase differences observed across preparations implies that modulated intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties, rather than the pattern of synaptic connections, are instrumental in determining phase within the timing network.},

Cardiac rhythm management devices provide therapies for both arrhythmias and resynchronisation but not heart failure, which affects millions of patients worldwide. This paper reviews recent advances in biophysics and mathematical engineering that provide a novel technological platform for addressing heart disease and enabling beat-to-beat adaptation of cardiac pacing in response to physiological feedback. The technology consists of silicon hardware central pattern generators (hCPGs) that may be trained to emulate accurately the dynamical response of biological central pattern generators (bCPGs). We discuss the limitations of present CPGs and appraise the advantages of analog over digital circuits for application in bioelectronic medicine. To test the system, we have focused on the cardio-respiratory oscillators in the medulla oblongata that modulate heart rate in phase with respiration to induce respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). We describe here a novel, scalable hCPG comprising physiologically realistic (Hodgkin\textendash{}Huxley type) neurones and synapses. Our hCPG comprises two neurones that antagonise each other to provide rhythmic motor drive to the vagus nerve to slow the heart. We show how recent advances in modelling allow the motor output to adapt to physiological feedback such as respiration. In rats, we report on the restoration of RSA using an hCPG that receives diaphragmatic electromyography input and use it to stimulate the vagus nerve at specific time points of the respiratory cycle to slow the heart rate. We have validated the adaptation of stimulation to alterations in respiratory rate. We demonstrate that the hCPG is tuneable in terms of the depth and timing of the RSA relative to respiratory phase. These pioneering studies will now permit an analysis of the physiological role of RSA as well as its any potential therapeutic use in cardiac disease.},

This circuit reliably produces a stereotyped fictive pattern of activity and has been extensively characterized. Here we determined, as quantitatively as possible, the strength of each inhibitory synapse and electrical junction within the core circuit of the heartbeat CPG. We also examined the animal-to-animal variability in strengths of these connections and, for some, determined the correlations between connections to the same postsynaptic target. The core CPG is composed of seven bilateral pairs of heart interneurons connected via both inhibitory chemical synapses and electrical junctions. Fifteen different connections within the core CPG were measured for strength using extracellular presynaptic recordings and postsynaptic voltage-clamp recordings across a minimum of seven individuals each, and the animal-to-animal variability was characterized. Connection strengths within the core network varied three to more than sevenfold among individuals (depending on the specific connection). The balance between two inputs onto various postsynaptic targets was explored by within-individual comparisons and correlation across individuals. Of the seven comparisons made within the core CPG, three showed a clear correlation of connection strengths, while the other four did not. We conclude that the leech heartbeat CPG can withstand wide variability in connection strengths and still produce stereotyped output. The network appears to preserve the relative strengths of some pairs of inputs, despite the animal-to-animal variability.},

  abstract = {This investigation of the leech heartbeat neural network system led to the development of a low resources, real-time, biomimetic digital hardware for use in hybrid experiments. The leech heartbeat neural network is one of the simplest central pattern generators (CPG). In biology, CPG provide the rhythmic bursts of spikes that form the basis for all muscle contraction orders (heartbeat) and locomotion (walking, running, etc.). The leech neural network system was previously investigated and this CPG formalized in the Hodgkin\textendash{}Huxley neural model (HH), the most complex devised to date. However, the resources required for a neural model are proportional to its complexity. In response to this issue, this article describes a biomimetic implementation of a network of 240 CPGs in an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), using a simple model (Izhikevich) and proposes a new synapse model: activity-dependent depression synapse. The network implementation architecture operates on a single computation core. This digital system works in real-time, requires few resources, and has the same bursting activity behavior as the complex model. The implementation of this CPG was initially validated by comparing it with a simulation of the complex model. Its activity was then matched with pharmacological data from the rat spinal cord activity. This digital system opens the way for future hybrid experiments and represents an important step toward hybridization of biological tissue and artificial neural networks. This CPG network is also likely to be useful for mimicking the locomotion activity of various animals and developing hybrid experiments for neuroprosthesis development.},

Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuro-modulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns.

Abrupt cooling of isolated nerve cords can induce additional changes in heart rate that are associated with `paradoxical' firing of motor neurons. 3.Heart rate was accelerated when mechanical stimuli were applied to the body wall of partially dissected preparations or when restrained preparations spontaneously initiated movements. For instance, marked acceleration of heart rate occurred when preparations exhibited body movements and motor neuron activity characteristic of swimming in intact animals. Activation of the motor program for swimming in isolated nerve cords led to acceleration of heartbeat oscillator cycling. Accelerations of heart rate associated with swimming are therefore mediated at least partially through central interactions. 4.Individual identified neurons were tested for their influence on the cycle rate of the heartbeat oscillator in isolated nerve cords. Activity of individual mechanosensory neurons was found to accelerate heart rate. Touch mechanosensory neurons were also found to influence the heartbeat oscillator through a rapidly adapting inhibitory pathway. Activity of individual motorneurons generally did not affect heart rate. Some interneurons and neuroeffector cells known to cause motor activation (e.g. swim initiating interneurons, serotonergic Retzius cells) can also produce acceleration of heart rate.},

  abstract = {We have created a computational model of the timing network that paces the heartbeat of the medicinal leech,Hirudo medicinalis. The rhythmic activity of this network originates from two segmental oscillators located in the third and fourth midbody ganglia. In the intact nerve cord, these segmental oscillators are mutually entrained to the same cycle period. Although experiments have shown that the segmental oscillators are coupled by inhibitory coordinating interneurons, the underlying mechanisms of intersegmental coordination have not yet been elucidated. To help understand this coordination, we have created a simple computational model with two variants: symmetric and asymmetric. In the symmetric model, neurons within each segmental oscillator called oscillator interneurons, inhibit the coordinating interneurons. In contrast, in the asymmetric model only the oscillator interneurons of one segmental oscillator inhibit the coordinating interneurons. In the symmetric model, when two segmental oscillators with different inherent periods are coupled, the faster one leads in phase, and the period of the coupled system is equal to the period of the faster oscillator. This behavior arises because, during each oscillation cycle, the oscillator interneurons of the faster segmental oscillator begin to burst before those of the slower oscillator, thereby terminating spike activity in the coordinating interneurons. Thus there is a brief period of time in each cycle when the oscillator interneurons of the slower segmental oscillator are relieved of inhibition from the coordinating interneurons. This ``removal of synaptic inhibition'' allows, within certain limits, the slower segmental oscillator to be sped to the period of the faster one. Thus the symmetric model demonstrates a plausible biophysical mechanism by which one segmental oscillator can entrain the other. In general the asymmetric model, in which only one segmental oscillator has the ability to inhibit the coordinating interneurons, behaves similarly, except only one segmental oscillator can control the period of the system. In addition, we simulated physiological experiments in which a ``driving'' stimulus, consisting of alternating positive and negative current steps, was used to control a single oscillator interneuron and thereby entrain the activity of the entire timing network.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that linearly correlated sets of parameters (intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons) allow central pattern-generating networks to produce and maintain their rhythmic activity regardless of changing internal and external conditions. To determine the role of correlated conductances in the robust maintenance of functional bursting activity, we used our existing database of half-center oscillator (HCO) model instances of the leech heartbeat CPG. From the database, we identified functional activity groups of burster (isolated neuron) and half-center oscillator model instances and realistic subgroups of each that showed burst characteristics (principally period and spike frequency) similar to the animal. To find linear correlations among the conductance parameters maintaining functional leech bursting activity, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to each of these four groups. PCA identified a set of three maximal conductances (leak current, 
Leak; a persistent K current, 
K2; and of a persistent Na+ current, 
P) that correlate linearly for the two groups of burster instances but not for the HCO groups. Visualizations of HCO instances in a reduced space suggested that there might be non-linear relationships between these parameters for these instances. Experimental studies have shown that period is a key attribute influenced by modulatory inputs and temperature variations in heart interneurons. Thus, we explored the sensitivity of period to changes in maximal conductances of 
Leak, 
K2, and 
P, and we found that for our realistic bursters the effect of these parameters on period could not be assessed because when varied individually bursting activity was not maintained., Central pattern-generating networks (CPGs) must be remarkably robust, maintaining functional rhythmic activity despite fluctuations in internal and external conditions. Recent experimental evidence suggests that this robustness is achieved by the coordinated regulation of many membrane and synaptic current parameters. Experimental and computational studies showed that linearly correlated sets of such parameters allow CPG neurons to produce and maintain their rhythmic activity. However, the mechanisms that allow multiple parameters to interact, thereby producing and maintaining rhythmic single cell and network activity, are not clear. Here, we use a half-center oscillator (HCO) model that replicates the electrical activity (rhythmic alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory interneurons) of the leech heartbeat CPG to investigate potential relationships between parameters that maintain functional bursting activity in the HCOs and the isolated component neurons (bursters). We found a linearly correlated set of three maximal conductances that maintains functional bursting activity similar to the animal in burster model instances, therefore increasing robustness of bursting activity. In addition, we found that bursting activity was very sensitive to individual variation of these parameters; only correlated changes could maintain the activity type.},

This model represents a network of six heart interneurons that comprise the basic rhythm-generating network within a single ganglion. This model builds on a previous two cell model (Nadim et al., 1995) by incorporating modifications of intrinsic and synaptic currents based on the results of a realistic waveform voltage-clamp study (Olsen and Calabrese, 1996). Due to these modifications, the new model behaves more similarly to the biological system than the previous model. For example, the slow-wave oscillation of membrane potential that underlies bursting is similar in form and amplitude to that of the biological system. Furthermore, the new model with its expanded architecture demonstrates how coordinating interneurons contribute to the oscillations within a single ganglion, in addition to their role of intersegmental coordination.},

  abstract = {To address the general problem of intersegmental coordination of oscillatory neuronal networks, we have studied the leech heartbeat central pattern generator. The core of this pattern generator is a timing network that consists of two segmental oscillators, each of which comprises two identified, reciprocally inhibitory oscillator interneurons. Intersegmental coordination between the segmental oscillators is mediated by synaptic interactions between the oscillator interneurons and identified coordinating interneurons. The small number of neurons (8) and the distributed structure of the timing network have made the experimental analysis of the segmental oscillators as discrete, independent units possible. On the basis of this experimental work, we have made conductance-based models to explore how intersegmental phase and cycle period are determined. We show that although a previous simple model, which ignored many details of the living system, replicated some essential features of the living system, the incorporation of specific cellular and network properties is necessary to capture the behavior of the system seen under different experimental conditions. For example, spike frequency adaptation in the coordinating interneurons and details of asymmetries in intersegmental connectivity are necessary for replicating driving experiments in which one segmental oscillator was injected with periodic current pulses to entrain the activity of the entire network. Nevertheless, the basic mechanisms of phase and period control demonstrated here appear to be very general and could be used by other networks that produce coordinated segmental motor outflow.},

In this study, we identified two additional pairs of interneurons that are part of the swim CPG: swim interneuron 3 (Si3) and swim interneuron 4 (Si4). The somata of Si3 and Si4 were both located in the pedal ganglion, near that of Si2, and both had axons that projected through the pedal commissure to the contralateral pedal ganglion. These neurons fulfilled the criteria for inclusion as members of the swim CPG: 1) they fired at a fixed phase in relation to Si1 and Si2, 2) brief changes in their activity reset the motor pattern, 3) prolonged changes in their activity altered the periodicity of the motor pattern, 4) they had monosynaptic connections with each other and with Si1 and Si2, and 5) their synaptic actions helped explain the phasing of the motor pattern. The results of this study show that the motor pattern has more complex internal dynamics than a simple left/right alternation of firing; the CPG circuit appears to be composed of two kernels of reciprocally inhibitory neurons, one consisting of Si1, Si2, and the contralateral Si4 and the other consisting of Si3. These two kernels interact with each other to produce a stable rhythmic motor pattern.},

Doxycycline was shown to decrease cerebral MMP-9 activities and angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the present study, we determined the dose-response effects of doxycycline and minocycline on cerebral MMP-9 using our mouse model with VEGF focal hyperstimulation delivered with adenoviral vector (AdVEGF) in the brain. Mice were treated with doxycycline or minocycline, respectively, at 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day through drinking water for 1 week. Our results have shown that MMP-9 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was inhibited by doxycycline starting at 10 mg/kg/day (P$<$0.02). Minocycline showed more potent inhibition on MMP-9 mRNA expression, starting at 1 (P$<$0.005) and further at more than 30 (P$<$0.001) mg/kg/day. At the enzymatic activity level, doxycycline started to suppress MMP-9 activity at 5 mg/kg/day (P$<$0.001), while minocycline had an effect at a lower dose, 1 mg/kg/day (P$<$0.02). The inhibition of cerebral MMP-9 mRNA and activity were highly correlated with drug levels in the brain tissue. We also assessed the potential relevant signaling pathway in vitro to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the MMP-9 inhibition by tetracyclines. In vitro, minocycline, but not doxycycline, inhibits MMP-9, at least in part, via the extracellular signaling-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-mediated pathway. This study provided the evidence that the tetracyclines inhibit stimulated cerebral MMP-9 at multiple levels and are effective at very low doses, offering great potential for therapeutic use.},

Gelatin-zymography technique was used to demonstrate the inhibitory activity of both tetracycline and glutathione. The intensity of the bands corresponding to metalloproteinase activity in zymography gel was reduced in the presence of 50\&\#x2013;100\&\#x2009;\&\#x3bc;g/mL of tetracycline. The presence of 10\&\#x2013;100\&\#x2009;\&\#x3bc;g/mL of tetracycline in the medium increased the adherence of L929 cancer cells. These results clearly indicate the antimetastatic property of tetracycline. Reduced glutathione, a compound which is produced endogenously by the cells to maintain the redox status, was shown to inhibit the matrix metalloproteinase activity (in vitro). Therefore, it is assumed that decreased glutathione levels in synovial fluids or plasma might increase the activity of MMP. Reduced glutathione at 100\&\#x2009;\&\#x3bc;g/mL inhibited the metalloproteinase activity in gelatin-zymographic gel. As both tetracycline and glutathione exhibited an inhibitory effect on matrix metalloproteinase activity, it was of great interest to check their clinical effects on various MMP associated pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis and arthritis.

  abstract = {Remodelling of the extracellular matrix and destruction of connective tissue are regarded as characteristic features of degenerative and invasive processes such as rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, wound healing, tumour growth and metastatic invasion. Matrix remodelling is a complex process in which matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a central role. MMP activity arises from a multi-step process, which is tightly regulated. Overexpression and activation of MMPs are correlated with a number of pathologies. Tetracyclines and tetracycline derivatives are able to inhibit MMP activity, independent of their anti-microbial action. The various MMPs have a different sensitivity for inhibition by tetracyclines: it is the strongest for MMP-8 and MMP-13, and weak or absent for MMP-1 and MMP-3. Inhibition ofin vitroactivity is strongly dependent on the assay conditions used (pH, kind of substrate, source of enzyme). Besides activity, the activation step of MMPs and MMP synthesis are also tetracycline-sensitive, varying per MMP. For a number of MMPs (MMP-8, MMP-9 and MMP-13), inhibition occurs at tetracycline levels which are physiologically obtainable upon therapy. In general, MMP inhibition by tetracyclines is observed in cells activated by growth factors or inflammatory mediators, in which MMP expression is induced. No effect of tetracyclines on the synthesis and action of TIMPs, inhibitors of MMPs, was observed. Use of tetracyclines in animal models and human diseases, in which MMPs play a role, reflects thein vitrosituation: inhibition of MMP synthesis and reduction or prevention of the pathological condition.},

  abstract = {Acoustic communication is essential for the reproductive success of the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus). During the breeding season, type I males use acoustic cues to advertise nest location to potential mates, creating an audible signal that attracts reproductive females. Type II (sneaker) males also likely use this social acoustic signal to find breeding pairs from which to steal fertilizations. Estrogen-induced changes in the auditory system of breeding females are thought to enhance neural encoding of the advertisement call, and recent anatomical data suggest the saccule (the main auditory end organ) as one possible target for this seasonal modulation. Here we describe saccular transcriptomes from all three sexual phenotypes (females, type I and II males) collected during the breeding season as a first step in understanding the mechanisms underlying sexual phenotype-specific and seasonal differences in auditory function. We used RNA-Seq on the Ion Torrent platform to create a combined transcriptome dataset containing over 79,000 assembled transcripts representing almost 9,000 unique annotated genes. These identified genes include several with known inner ear function and multiple steroid hormone receptors. Transcripts most closely matched to published genomes of nile tilapia and large yellow croaker, inconsistent with the phylogenetic relationship between these species but consistent with the importance of acoustic communication in their life-history strategies. We then compared the RNA-Seq results from the saccules of reproductive females with a separate transcriptome from the non-reproductive female phenotype and found over 700 differentially expressed transcripts, including members of the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways that mediate cell proliferation and hair cell addition in the inner ear. These data constitute a valuable resource for furthering our understanding of the molecular basis for peripheral auditory function as well as a range of future midshipman and cross-species comparative studies of the auditory periphery.},

Here, we highlight new results for ectothermic vertebrates, namely teleost fish and amphibians, showing how androgenic steroids can influence the temporal patterning of CPGs for social vocalization. Investigations of vocalizing teleosts show how androgens can rapidly (within minutes) modulate the neurophysiological output of the vocal CPG (fictive vocalizations that mimic the temporal properties of natural vocalizations) inclusive of their divergent actions between species, as well as intraspecific differences between male reproductive morphs. Studies of anuran amphibians (frogs) demonstrate that long-term steroid treatments (wks) can masculinize the fictive vocalizations of females, inclusive of its sensitivity to rapid modulation by serotonin. Given the conserved organization of vocal control systems across vertebrate groups, the vocal CPGs of fish and amphibians provide tractable models for identifying androgen-dependent events that are fundamental to the mechanisms of vocal motor patterning. These basic mechanisms can also inform our understanding of the more complex CPGs for vocalization, and social behaviors in general, that have evolved among birds and mammals.},

Toadfishes are among the best-known groups of sound-producing (vocal) fishes and include species commonly known as toadfish and midshipman. Although midshipman have been the subject of extensive investigation of the neural mechanisms of vocalization, this is the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of the spectro-temporal characters of their acoustic signals and one of the few for fishes in general. Field recordings of territorial, nest-guarding male midshipman during the breeding season identified a diverse vocal repertoire composed of three basic sound types that varied widely in duration, harmonic structure and degree of amplitude modulation (AM): `hum', `grunt' and `growl'. Hum duration varied nearly 1000-fold, lasting for minutes at a time, with stable harmonic stacks and little envelope modulation throughout the sound. By contrast, grunts were brief, \textasciitilde{}30\textendash{}140 ms, broadband signals produced both in isolation and repetitively as a train of up to 200 at intervals of \textasciitilde{}0.5\textendash{}1.0 s. Growls were also produced alone or repetitively, but at variable intervals of the order of seconds with durations between those of grunts and hums, ranging 60-fold from \textasciitilde{}200 ms to 12 s. Growls exhibited prominent harmonics with sudden shifts in pulse repetition rate and highly variable AM patterns, unlike the nearly constant AM of grunt trains and flat envelope of hums. Behavioral and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis that each sound type's unique acoustic signature contributes to signal recognition mechanisms. Nocturnal production of these sounds against a background chorus dominated constantly for hours by a single sound type, the multi-harmonic hum, reveals a novel underwater soundscape for fish.},

  abstract = {Background
Circadian clocks are biological oscillators that regulate molecular, physiological, and behavioral rhythms in a wide variety of organisms. While behavioral rhythms are typically monitored over many cycles, a similar approach to molecular rhythms was not possible until recently; the advent of real-time analysis using transgenic reporters now permits the observations of molecular rhythms over many cycles as well. This development suggests that new details about the relationship between molecular and behavioral rhythms may be revealed. Even so, behavioral and molecular rhythmicity have been analyzed using different methods, making such comparisons difficult to achieve. To address this shortcoming, among others, we developed a set of integrated analytical tools to unify the analysis of biological rhythms across modalities.

Results
We demonstrate an adaptation of digital signal analysis that allows similar treatment of both behavioral and molecular data from our studies of Drosophila. For both types of data, we apply digital filters to extract and clarify details of interest; we employ methods of autocorrelation and spectral analysis to assess rhythmicity and estimate the period; we evaluate phase shifts using crosscorrelation; and we use circular statistics to extract information about phase.

Conclusion
Using data generated by our investigation of rhythms in Drosophila we demonstrate how a unique aggregation of analytical tools may be used to analyze and compare behavioral and molecular rhythms. These methods are shown to be versatile and will also be adaptable to further experiments, owing in part to the non-proprietary nature of the code we have developed.},

Numerical solutions may be obtained for any particular model by inserting expressions describing the terminations and parameter values into the program, without further computation by the modeler. For a finite length cable, sealed at one end, the solution is expressed in terms of the ratio of the termination impedance to the impedance of the finite length cable, a generalization of the steady-state conductance ratio. Analysis of a model of a soma with several primary dendrites shows that the dendrites may be lumped into one equivalent cylinder if they have the same electrotonic length, even though they may vary in diameter. Responses obtained under voltage clamp are conceptually predictable from measurements made under current clamp, and vice versa. The equalizing time constants of an infinite series expression of the solution are the negative reciprocals of the roots of the characteristic equation. Examination of computed solutions shows that solutions which differ theoretically may be indistinguishable experimentally.},

  abstract = {Conductance-based neuron models aid in understanding the role intrinsic and synaptic currents play in producing neuronal activity. Incorporating morphological detail into a model allows for additional analysis of non-homogeneous distributions of active and synaptic conductances, as well as spatial segregation of electrical events. We developed a morphologically detailed ``Full Model'' of a leech heart interneuron that replicates reasonably well intracellular recordings from these interneurons. However, it comprises hundreds of compartments, each increasing parameter space and simulation time. To reduce the number of compartments of the Full Model, while preserving conductance densities and distributions, its compartments were grouped into functional groups that each share identical conductance densities. Each functional group was sequentially reduced to one or two compartments, preserving surface area, conductance densities and its contribution to input resistance. As a result, the input resistance and membrane time constant were preserved. The axial resistances of several compartments were rescaled to match the amplitude of synaptic currents and low-threshold calcium currents and the shape of action potentials to those in the Full Model. This reduced model, with intrinsic conductances, matched the activity of the Full Model for a variety of simulated current-clamp and voltage-clamp data. Because surface area and conductance distribution of the functional groups of the Full Model were maintained, parameter changes introduced into the reduced model can be directly translated to the Full Model. Thus, our computationally efficient reduced morphology model can be used as a tool for exploring the parameter space of the Full Model and in network simulations.},

Applying this approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical sequence towards peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.},

Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

Even after about 40 years of intensive studies, the rhythm genesis is still not rigorously understood in this CPG, mainly because it is made of neurons with irregular intrinsic activity. Using mathematical models we addressed the question of using a network of irregularly behaving elements to generate periodic oscillations, and we show some advantages of using non-periodic neurons with intrinsic behavior in the transition from bursting to tonic spiking (as found in biological pyloric CPGs) as building components. We studied two- and three-neuron model CPGs built either with Hindmarsh-Rose or with conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley-like model neurons. By changing a model's parameter we could span the neuron's intrinsic dynamical behavior from slow periodic bursting to fast tonic spiking, passing through a transition where irregular bursting was observed. Two-neuron CPG, half center oscillator (HCO), was obtained for each intrinsic behavior of the neurons by coupling them with mutual symmetric synaptic inhibition. Most of these HCOs presented regular antiphasic bursting activity and the changes of the bursting frequencies was studied as a function of the inhibitory synaptic strength. Among all HCOs, those made of intrinsic irregular neurons presented a wider burst frequency range while keeping a reliable regular oscillatory (bursting) behavior. HCOs of periodic neurons tended to be either hard to change their behavior with synaptic strength variations (slow periodic burster neurons) or unable to perform a physiologically meaningful rhythm (fast tonic spiking neurons). Moreover, 3-neuron CPGs with connectivity and output similar to those of the pyloric CPG presented the same results.},

These circuits are typically built of half-center oscillator subcircuits with reciprocally inhibitory connections. Another common property in many CPGs is the remarkable rich spiking-bursting dynamics of their constituent cells, which balance robustness and flexibility to generate their joint coordinated rhythms. In this paper, we use conductance-based models and realistic connection topologies inspired by the crustacean pyloric CPG to address the study of asymmetry factors shaping CPG bursting rhythms. In particular, we assess the role of asymmetric maximal synaptic conductances, time constants and gap-junction connectivity to establish the regularity of half-center oscillator based CPGs. We map and characterize the synaptic parameter space that lead to regular and irregular bursting activity in these networks. The analysis indicates that asymmetric configurations display robust regular rhythms and that large regions of both regular and irregular but coordinated rhythms exist as a function of the asymmetry in the circuit. Our results show that asymmetry both in the maximal conductances and in the temporal dynamics of mutually inhibitory neurons can synergistically contribute to shape wide regimes of regular spiking-bursting activity in CPGs. Finally, we discuss how a closed-loop protocol driven by a regularity goal can be used to find and characterize regular regimes when there is not time to perform an exhaustive search, as in most experimental studies.},

Realistic modeling is based on a detailed biophysical description of neurons and synapses, which can be integrated into microcircuits. The latter can, in turn, be further integrated to form large-scale brain networks and eventually to reconstruct complex brain systems. Here we provide a review of the realistic simulation strategy and use the cerebellar network as an example. This network has been carefully investigated at molecular and cellular level and has been the object of intense theoretical investigation. The cerebellum is thought to lie at the core of the forward controller operations of the brain and to implement timing and sensory prediction functions. The cerebellum is well described and provides a challenging field in which one of the most advanced realistic microcircuit models has been generated. We illustrate how these models can be elaborated and embedded into robotic control systems to gain insight into how the cellular properties of cerebellar neurons emerge in integrated behaviors. Realistic network modeling opens up new perspectives for the investigation of brain pathologies and for the neurorobotic field.},

  abstract = {Changes in temperature affect biochemical reaction rates and, consequently, neural processing. The nervous systems of poikilothermic animals must have evolved mechanisms enabling them to retain their functionality under varying temperatures. Auditory receptor neurons of grasshoppers respond to sound in a surprisingly temperature-compensated manner: firing rates depend moderately on temperature, with average Q10 values around 1.5. Analysis of conductance-based neuron models reveals that temperature compensation of spike generation can be achieved solely relying on cell-intrinsic processes and despite a strong dependence of ion conductances on temperature. Remarkably, this type of temperature compensation need not come at an additional metabolic cost of spike generation. Firing rate-based information transfer is likely to increase with temperature and we derive predictions for an optimal temperature dependence of the tympanal transduction process fostering temperature compensation. The example of auditory receptor neurons demonstrates how neurons may exploit single-cell mechanisms to cope with multiple constraints in parallel., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02078.001, Warm-blooded animals\textemdash{}including mammals and birds\textemdash{}expend large amounts of energy in keeping their body temperature constant regardless of how hot or cold their environment is. By contrast, the body temperature of cold-blooded animals\textemdash{}including amphibians, reptiles, and insects\textemdash{}follows that of their surroundings. Cold-blooded animals must therefore have evolved a means to cope with the effects of changes in temperature, but exactly how they do this is not clear., Now, Roemschied et al. have obtained new insights into this process by studying the nerve cells in grasshoppers that allow them to hear sounds. The auditory system of the grasshopper comprises sensory receptor neurons that are located on the abdomen of the insect. Sound waves move the tympanal membrane, which causes ion channels within the cell membranes to open. This enables the neurons to produce an electrical signal known as a spike., Recordings from grasshoppers revealed that changing the outside temperature by up to 10$^\circ$C affected the rate at which the neurons produced spikes by only about half the amount expected. Given that these neurons do not receive inputs from any other cells, this ability to withstand changes in temperature must be intrinsic to the neurons themselves. Consistent with this, computational modeling showed that while the activity of individual ion channels did indeed vary with changes in temperature, these changes in ion channel activity had little overall effect on the rate at which a neuron produced spikes., Whereas it has previously been assumed that compensation for changes in temperature occurs at the level of networks of neurons, the work of Roemschied et al. reveals that such compensation can occur in individual cells, and that it need not require a lot of energy to be expended., DOI:

Because temperature is a global perturbation that differentially influences every biological process within the nervous system, one might therefore expect that individual animals would respond differently to temperature. Nonetheless, the phase relationships of the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis, are remarkably invariant between 7 and 23$^\circ$C (Tang et al., 2010). Here, we report that, when isolated STG preparations were exposed to more extreme temperature ranges, their networks became nonrhythmic, or "crashed", in a reversible fashion. Animals were acclimated for at least 3 weeks at 7, 11, or 19$^\circ$C. When networks from the acclimated animals were perturbed by acute physiologically relevant temperature ramps (11-23$^\circ$C), the network frequency and phase relationships were independent of the acclimation group. At high acute temperatures ($>$23$^\circ$C), circuits from the cold-acclimated animals produced less-regular pyloric rhythms than those from warm-acclimated animals. At high acute temperatures, phase relationships between pyloric neurons were more variable from animal to animal than at moderate acute temperatures, suggesting that individual differences across animals in intrinsic circuit parameters are revealed at high temperatures. This shows that individual and variable neuronal circuits can behave similarly in normal conditions, but their behavior may diverge when confronted with extreme external perturbations.},

Oscillations in neural activity are a prominent feature of many brain states. Individual hippocampal neurons exhibit intrinsic membrane potential oscillations and intrinsic resonance in the theta frequency range. We found that the subthreshold resonance frequency of CA1 pyramidal neurons was location dependent, varying more than 3-fold between the soma and the distal dendrites. Furthermore, activity- and NMDA-receptor-dependent long-term plasticity increased this resonance frequency through changes in h channel properties. The increase in resonance frequency and an associated reduction in excitability were nearly identical in the soma and the first 300 $\mu$m of the apical dendrites. These spatially widespread changes accompanying long-term synaptic potentiation also reduced the neuron's ability to elicit spikes evoked through a nonpotentiated synaptic pathway. Our results suggest that the frequency response of these neurons depends on the dendritic location of their inputs and that activity can regulate their response dynamics within an oscillating neural network.},

Understanding how these biophysical differences affect network-level computation is an important frontier. We focus on a set of biophysical properties, experimentally observed in developing cortical neurons, that allow these neurons to efficiently encode their inputs despite time-varying changes in the statistical context. Large-scale propagating waves are autonomously generated by the developing brain even before the onset of sensory experience. Using multi-layered feedforward networks, we examine how changes in intrinsic properties can lead to changes in the network's ability to represent and transmit information on multiple timescales. We demonstrate that measured changes in the computational properties of immature single neurons enable the propagation of slow-varying wave-like inputs. In contrast, neurons with more mature properties are more sensitive to fast fluctuations, which modulate the slow-varying information. While slow events are transmitted with high fidelity in initial network layers, noise degrades transmission in downstream network layers. Our results show how short-term adaptation and modulation of the neurons' input-output firing curves by background synaptic noise determine the ability of neural networks to transmit information on multiple timescales.},

To reliably encode a wide range of signals, neurons need to achieve a broad range of firing frequencies and to move smoothly between low and high firing rates. This can be achieved with specific ionic currents, such as A-type potassium currents, which can linearize the frequency-input current curve. By applying recently developed mathematical tools to a number of biophysical neuron models, we show how currents that are classically thought to permit low firing rates can paradoxically cause a jump to a high minimum firing rate when expressed at higher levels. Consequently, achieving and maintaining a low firing rate is surprisingly difficult and fragile in a biological context. This difficulty can be overcome via interactions between multiple currents, implying a need for ion channel degeneracy in the tuning of neuronal properties.},

Based on respiratory nerve discharge, the respiratory cycle can be divided into three phases: inspiration, postinspiration and stage 2 expiration. 2. Six basic types of respiratory neuron participate in respiratory rhythmogenesis. Their firing and membrane potential patterns are locked to different phases of the respiratory cycle. 3. In adult mammals, respiratory neurons are subject to excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs and show extensive synaptic interconnections that are mainly inhibitory. There are differences in the relative importance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drives and the neurotransmitters involved in respiratory rhythmogenesis in neonates compared with adults. 4. Respiratory neurons possess a number of intrinsic membrane currents that may be involved in central pattern generation, including low- and high-voltage-activated calcium, potassium, calcium-dependent potassium, sodium and mixed cationic currents. More quantitative information is needed about the distribution and characteristics of these ionic currents if we are to understand rhythmogenesis. 5. The two main theories for the origin of respiratory rhythm are those of pacemaker neuron-driven and synaptic network-driven CPG. Evidence derived from in vivo and in vitro experiments exists to support both of these theories.

RPCH produced several-fold increases in the amplitude of both action potential\textendash{}mediated and non\textendash{}impulse-mediated transmission that persisted for as long as the peptide remained present. Because the LP to PD synapse is the only feedback to the pacemaker kernel of the pyloric network, which consists of the electrically coupled two PD neurons and the anterior burster (AB) neuron, it might have been expected that strengthening the LP to PD synapse would increase the period of the pyloric rhythm. However, the period of the pyloric rhythm increased only transiently in RPCH, and a transient increase in cycle period was observed even when the LP neuron was hyperpolarized. Phase response curves were measured using the dynamic clamp to create artificial inhibitory inputs of variable strength and duration to the PD neurons. Synaptic conductance values seen in normal saline were ineffective at changing the pyloric period throughout the pyloric cycle. Conductances similar to those seen in 10-6 M RPCH also did not evoke phase resets at phases when the LP neuron is typically active. Thus the dramatic effects of RPCH on synaptic strength have little role in modulation of the period of the pyloric rhythm under normal operating conditions but may help to stabilize the rhythm when the cycle period is too slow or too fast.},

Schizophrenia is still one of the most mysterious and costliest mental disorders in terms of human suffering and societal expenditure. Here, we focus on the key developments in biology, epidemiology, and pharmacology of schizophrenia and provide a syndromal framework in which these aspects can be understood together. Symptoms typically emerge in adolescence and early adulthood. The incidence of the disorder varies greatly across places and migrant groups, as do symptoms, course, and treatment response across individuals. Genetic vulnerability is shared in part with bipolar disorder and recent molecular genetic findings also indicate an overlap with developmental disorders such as autism. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is associated with demonstrable alterations in brain structure and changes in dopamine neurotransmission, the latter being directly related to hallucinations and delusions. Pharmacological treatments, which block the dopamine system, are effective for delusions and hallucinations but less so for disabling cognitive and motivational impairments. Specific vocational and psychological interventions, in combination with antipsychotic medication in a context of community-case management, can improve functional outcome but are not widely available. 100 years after being so named, research is beginning to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the symptoms of schizophrenia and the psychosocial factors that moderate their expression. Although current treatments provide control rather than cure, long-term hospitalisation is not required and prognosis is better than traditionally assumed.$<$/p$>$

Cannabis contains psychoactive components, notably $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC), that interfere with the brain's endogenous endocannabinoid system, which is critically involved in both pre- and post-natal neurodevelopment. Consequently, THC and related compounds could potentially usurp normal adolescent neurodevelopment, shifting the brain's developmental trajectory towards a disease-vulnerable state, predisposing early cannabis-users to motivational, affective and psychotic disorders. Numerous human studies, including prospective longitudinal studies, demonstrate that early cannabis use is associated with major depressive disorder and drug addiction. A strong association between schizophrenia and cannabis use is also apparent, especially when considering genetic factors that interact with this environmental exposure. These human studies set a foundation for carefully controlled animal studies which demonstrate similar patterns following early cannabinoid exposure. Given the vulnerable nature of adolescent neurodevelopment and the persistent changes that follow early cannabis exposure, the experimental findings outlined should be carefully considered by policymakers. In order to fully address the growing issues of psychiatric illnesses and to ensure a healthy future, measures should be taken to reduce cannabis use among teens.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To survey recent developments in the English-language philosophy of psychopathology.
RECENT FINDINGS: First, we present books - by Gallagher and Zahavi (2008) and by Thompson (2007) -that integrate phenomenology with cognitive science and neuroscience. This is followed by discussion of critical assessments of the DSM-III operational legacy and practical consequences recently offered by various psychiatrists, including Andreasen, Mullen,and Maj. These very bleak assessments are considered in light of certain new trends in explanatory models of psychiatry and associated metaphysical concerns. Finally, we concentrate on the phenomenological approach to schizophrenia, enjoying a renaissance in psychiatric literature. We emphasize the recent work on the issue of self disorders as a core aspect of psychopathology of schizophrenia and criticize the accuracy of a recent survey (published in this journal) of phenomenological approaches to schizophrenia, thereby rectifying important misunderstandings.
SUMMARY: The review emphasizes the fundamental importance of philosophy of psychopathology in clarifying concepts, highlighting epistemological problems, and helping to provide adequate distinctions at the phenomenological level for use in empirical research.},

  abstract = {Though the causes of violence in our society are complex, the troublesome human emotions of anger and rage play a central role in the genesis of violent behavior and psychopathology in general. In this provocative book, clinical and forensic psychologist Stephen A. Diamond determines where rage and anger originate and explores whether these powerful passions are--as most people resume--purely negative, pathological, and evil or can be meaningfully redeemed and redirected into constructive activity. Using clinical and biographical case studies, as well as striking visual images, he traces anger, rage, and violence through their most destructive expressions to their creative and transcendent functions in art, psychotherapy, and spirituality.},
